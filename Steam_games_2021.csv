40271,Obsideo,2021-08-27,11.99,207,Kyle's Garage,Kyle's Garage,"Action,Indie,Early Access","Obsideo is a 1-4 player online co-op psychological horror, where you and your team of priests explore different locations experiencing paranormal events in an attempt to figure out what ghost they're dealing with and exorcise it from the property. You will use your ghost hunting equipment, along with a 'Ghostpedia' to try and locate where the ghost is, and the type of ghost you're dealing with. Obsideo focuses more on paying attention to context clues and what the ghost looks like, and how it interacts with the environment, as opposed to finding specific item clues and basing everything off that, this allows for a lot more replayability and keeps each playthrough unique. I also wanted everything to revolve around exorcisms, therefor every item that the ghost interacts with (Spirit box, EMF, Geiger Counter), all changes how you approach an exorcism. There are currently over 55 ghost interactions in the game, these range anywhere from a subtle move of a plate, or disembodied breathing, through to the ghost completely smashing walls, or making it rain blood. You need to pay close attention to what the ghost is doing, as it tells you exactly what ghost you're dealing with. Terrifyingly Realistic Ghost AI: Not only can they always hear you, but the ghosts will use their own knowledge of the house against you and attempt to cut you off or trap you in dead zones with nowhere to hide or escape. Unique Ghosts: Over 15 different ghosts planned for you to try and exorcise, all with different traits, personalities, and abilities. Equipment: Use popular ghost hunting equipment, such as EMF Readers, Thermometers, and RemPods to make contact with the ghost, and find out how to exorcise it from the house. Immersive Experience: All our houses are modeled to scale off real-world houses, along with having life-like graphics, Obsideo also features realistic ambient sounds that will completely immerse you within its world. Intent Recognition: Talk to the ghosts with your real voice through your microphone and they will completely understand almost everything you say, along with deciding exactly how they want to reply to that.",754,9040.46,399,856,0,True,2021

54860,TrackMaster: Free-For-All Motorsport,2021-03-08,7.99,0,The Motor Game Company,The Motor Game Company,"Action,Casual,Racing,Sports,Early Access","Hi, I'm a solo game developer from São Paulo, Brazil, and this is my game! TrackMaster is a game about physics sandbox, racing, vehicular mess and crazy types of events and competitions: doing unexpected things with unexpected vehicles! Want to take a trailer truck to a stunt track? Why not? Want to do a race in a figure 8 track featuring a monster truck, a muscle car, a truck and a bus? Why not? The game will let you drive freely in any track in a freeroam mode, race in tracks designed for collisions, and take part in events for doing stunts, dominating the hill, playing football and many others! TrackMaster is really a project I have began because of those moments of 'if no one is making the game I want to play, I'll make it'. I want the physics and chaos of the old Destruction Derby games, the freedom of old games like Interstate'76 and of modern games like BeamNGDrive, the simplicity of Super Off-Road and Super Skidmarks, the crazy modes of Test Drive: Eve of Destruction, the mayhem of Twisted Metal (the first one), the Monster Trucks from Monster Truck Madness, all this with split screen multiplayer, and more, much more, is that too much to ask? The game is designed as a balanced blend of simulation and fun: the vehicles are entirely governed by physics, so that you can always see a different result from collisions, jumps and stunts. The vehicles sizes and weights are also proportional to each other as in real life. If you drive a 6 ton truck at 100 km/h into regular cars, expect the poor cars to get thown away. But here comes the balance to be fun: the truck won't take 15 seconds to reach 100 km/h (as it would in real life), it's acceleration will let it race against sports cars and other fast vehicles! The physics based system also allows for different handling of RWD (rear wheel drive), FWD (front wheel drive) and 4WD (4 wheel drive) vehicles. GAME MODES FreeRoam - Drive freely, no time limits and no goals in any arena or track. - AVAILABLE NOW Event - Races and other events, see EVENTS, below. - AVAILABLE NOW Career - Start as a novice driver, with a bad car, and try to climb up the racing ranks! - COMING SOON Tournament - Combinations of events in sequence. - COMING SOON EVENTS 14 event types ALREADY IN THE GAME FreeStyle - Do as many tricks as you can in 2 minutes. Front flips, back flips, spiral flips, long and high jumps. Or, prevent the others from doing their hard trained tricks. Racing - You know, try to reach the finish line first. In this game, that's the only rule. Master of the Hill - Stay as long as you can on top of the hill for 2 minutes. Also, make sure the other vehicles can't make it. Tag - Or 'Touch And Go', the playground game, the one you played as a child. Now with big toys. Red Rover - Drive from one end of the arena to the other. The last vehicle each time is out, until there is only one, the winner. Kamikaze Race - A race event where half the vehicles drive the right way. The other half, the wrong way. COMING SOON There and Back Race - Also race, but you drive one lap the right way, the next lap, the wrong way. And so on until finish. Around the Flag Race - And yet another race event: after each lap, make a circle around a flag in the middle of the track, and then proceed to the next lap. Football - You know, one ball, two goals. Period. Capture the Flag - Two teams, each one with a flag. Take the other teams flag and bring to your base. Demolition - Destroy anything that moves. Cops and Robbers - Or 'Team Tag '. You also played this one as a child. Now, with big toys too. Power Potato - Stay most of the time with the potato. Touch the vehicle with the potato to steal it. Hot Potato - Stay away from the potato. The one carrying it, loses points. Touch other vehicles to pass on the potato. Trailer Mode - All of the above, but with trailers attached. Try to finish the event with your trailers, and try to make the other vehicles lose theirs. THE PLAN You can see how I'm planning to develop the game along 2021 in the TrackMaster website. Also, I will present these updates here, on Steam. So, the plan: Middle of 2022. The game at this point will feature all the vehicles (7 classes, with a varying number of models inside each class, to a total of 15 models), 11 tracks (plus the tracks variations) and 14 game modes planned now. 1.0 (end of early access phase) is planned to the end of 2022. The game at this point will feature on-line multiplayer, LAN multiplayer, track editor and of course, more vehicles, tracks and game modes are going to be made. Nothing prevents some features to come out earlier than planned, like online multiplayer, I just can't promise it now. After 1.0, free updates with more of everything described above, and, why not, some new and cool things, like an open world, real world tracks, steering wheel support, vehicle destruction (with soft body physics!), missions and scenarios... but this are just dreams right now and I can't promise any of this. So, the idea is to build a racing game that is easy to play, with a nice balance of fun and physics simulation, so that there are always new stuff to do and try, but that you can play in a relaxed way if you want. As long as the game proves to be good and is financially viable, I don't plan to abandon it after some features have being added, it could go on for years, why not!? I really like the way games like Euro/American Truck Simulator, BeamNGDrive, Cities Skylines and Elite Dangerous are made: with great involvement from a community and constant and free updates and improvements. I don't think I'm going for the paid DLC way, even for the big content updates. I like the idea of a game you can have at the beginning, with just a few features, but a solid foundation, and years later you are still able to have fun with it, but with much more content, and more important, with no more money for it. So, if you like the idea of a racing game to play the way you want, with any vehicle that comes to your mind, in crazy tracks, with lots of chaos, mayhem and solid physics, I hope you can enjoy the game from now on!",8,63.92,8,1028,0,True,2021

You live alone as an obese virgin in your tiny four-and-a-half mat shoebox of an apartment, which is itself a disused relic of a bygone era. Your libido is incredible, but with no cash and no credit, you can't afford to clean yourself up, let alone afford the services of the ladies of the night. Every night, you get home exhausted. You eat, if only for the nourishment, and then collapse to sleep like a pile of mud on the floor. Every morning you wake up, and do it again. Your room is a mess that you never clean up, a reflection of the desolation in your heart. Still, you never snap: You hold it together, in a twisted subversion of your gentle nature. One day, things change. “What cramped, filthy confines. Protists. This is why we call them primitive, I suppose.” You've just gotten back to your decrepit apartment and slunk your blubber into the futon... That's when an explosion of light and a flood of sound fill your apartment. There, like a thunderclap, stands a stranger. You stand stunned. She's beautiful. Some category past supermodel that you've never even heard of. It's well beyond the level of just a pretty face. She exudes natural confidence in an aura so strong you can see it.

To put it vulgarly, hot DAMN those are nice tits. You do a quick double-take. Those things would put any porn actress to shame. If the rest of her were any less breathtaking, you might not be able to get your eyes off them. Those breasts are enough of a feast for the eyes to satisfy you for a lifetime, on their own.

This mysterious woman⁠—the Demon Queen, to hear her tell it⁠—licks her lips with a bewitching smile as she pushes you down. She needs to stock up on magic⁠, and it seems you're a tanker. “You're a veritable fountainhead of energy... It's difficult to believe that you never realized what you had hanging between your legs.” Squeezing your throbbing hard-on, smiling like a cat, she goes on to explain.

47660,La Porte des Fauconniers : Guerre Médiévale,2021-11-12,9.99,0,Bastion Studio (FR),Bastion Studio (FR),"Indie,RPG,Strategy,Early Access","Short Presentation Falconers’ Gate (FG) is a medieval action RPG, with a strong tactical component. FG is an uchronia ; its scenario is a rewrite of History, as it might have been with a few alterations of the past. The game is set in a fictional version of 11st century medieval Normandy. Key Elements: Discover Medieval Normandy Recruit and lead your own army in epic multiplayer battle Customize your hero and your troops from levy to elite mailed troops Enjoy a slow paced gameplay focused on tactic and manoeuver. Detailed Presentation October 14th, 1066: A Uchronia in the Skies William the Conqueror is preparing to fight the Anglo-Saxons at the famous battle of Hastings. If he wins, a substantial part of England will be his to take. On the other side of the Channel, in the heart of his duchy of Normandy, a comet streaks the night sky shortly before crashing down on the village of L’Aigle. The fall of this celestial body on St. Martin’s Church is about to trigger a series of events that will upset the course of history as we know it, and unleash a terrible power struggle for the control of “Falconers Gate.” You, the Comet’s Chosen One, are a Falconer at the head of your company, caught in the throes of a war that will lay waste to the region. Will you be on the side of History or on the side of Change? History Vs. Fantasy Fantasy will be introduced progressively and will not be all over the game, much like in the universe of Game of Thrones. In particular, fantasy will be used as a means to integrate and rationalize the existence of certain comfort tools for gamers, such as Strategic View and even TPV (Third-Person View). Combat Mechanics Directional Fencing FG uses a directional combo based combat system for the player. When you attack in a direction, its launch a side attack and 3 of its variation. At any time, you can change the side of your attack. An armor worthy of the name The pieces of armor used in FG will not only reduce the injuries you may suffer; if they are thick enough they will completely block the enemy strikes. The game also features a damage system based on different kinds of strikes : slashing, blunt-force, and piercing, all with different properties depending on the three types of materials used for your protection: Fabric, Quilted, Mesh / Plates. Health/Conscience/Stamina System FG features a health system that seeks to reproduce the complexity of wearing armor on a battlefield during prolonged periods of combat, without excessively interfering with the game mechanics. Each body part has its own hitbox and its own health points. Losing an arm will cost you the use of the corresponding equipment. However, as long as your chest and head are intact, you can always take flight or continue fighting with what you are carrying in your other hand. That is, if you still have your legs! Your Army Epic Battles From the Forest of Écouves to the plains of the Pays d’Auge, you will do battle against your enemies in realistic environments! FG will immerse you in battles involving hundreds of warriors in 1vs1 to 5vs5 battle, with each player leading 40 to 100 men at the same time. Units Each group of combatants uses its own particular set of military formations. The game features a huge variety of units : spearmen, pikemen, swordmen, axeman, javelinmen, all coming with their particular ability and formation. Spearmen can form a specific shield wall when swordsmen can gather around you and follow you in the middle of battle. Archers and Javelinemen use a realistic ballistic with arrows hitting each other on their way to your ennemy and break on heavy armor. Army Customization As soon as you recruit a combat unit, it will start to grow and evolve over the course of time (and depending on the various encounters they follow you in). Units will vary in kind, depending on whether you are recruiting in a town or village (rural or urban militia) or on whether you are directly hiring mercenaries. You may recruit up to 3 groups of 20 to 47 combatants, in order to form your 60 to 100-man company according to the style of gameplay that suits you best. You are free to staff your company homogeneously with soldiers specializing in a certain kind of weapon, or to form a versatile combat group skilled in fighting with different kinds of weapons. An Endless Range of Possibilities Each of your 3 combat squads will have its own combination of skills and experience. The skill tree may feature linear branches affording huge bonuses but require that you stick to a precise path, or may allow you to choose between different nodes whose effects can vary in interest but offer a broader range of choices. You will thus benefit from a significant number of possibilities that can transform your unorganized and unruly peasants into robust soldiers, trained in a variety of devastating combat techniques. From Footmen to Knights FG’s combat units will be organized into Infantry and Cavalry: The Cavalry will focus mainly on its ability to launch irresistible charges whilst carefully avoiding a wall of lances anchored in the ground. The Infantry will occupy the field through sheer mass, the use of formations, and methodical progression. Archers will work differently from classical units. Once unlocked and recruited, they will accompany you in battle as a support unit. You will decide when they should shoot their arrows “outside of the map” or when to order them to pick a fixed position where they can stick their arrows in the ground in order to shoot faster. Shields Up! The skills that you will be able to choose for your combat units will range from passive abilities (bonus health, increased stamina…) and active skills that you can use during battle. For instance, being able to charge the enemy (slow or at full speed) is one of the most common abilities in FG. But many other ability exist in the game with different effect and utility. Other Features An innovative tactical interface Your character’s skills will be mainly practical. Falconers are no super-heroes; even though you will be definitely stronger than the average soldier, it will be impossible for you to take on an army on your own. Falconer’s View will be your main practical skill. It will grant you a tactical view of the battlefield in an instant, allowing you to optimize your troops’ position in just a few clicks. You will be granted a large choice of skills, ranging from a simple area buff or debuff to special strikes combos. Much like your units, your skill tree (of which your Sergeants have a similar variant) will lead you to make decisive choices: specialize in one skill or unlock several of them, improve a wide range of characteristics or excel in one type of buff… -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- We are looking forward to take you with us through Falconers’ Gate!",16,159.84,15,779,0,True,2021

24376,Ningakki XXVI FPS,2021-09-25,0.0,0,WilliamDColburn,WilliamDColburn,"Action,Early Access","For many years, it has been apparent that any idiot can write a game and publish it on Steam. This year, I decided to become one of those idiots. The first iteration of my attempts is the Ningakki XXVI FPS game, written in Unity, and reliant upon the Unity FPS Microgame for core functionality. The game is set in an abandoned post-apocalyptic world where the player seems to be the only remaining living animal. One hundred and one robots, however, still exist, and they plan to extinguish the last animal on 'their' planet. The terrain is procedurally generated, and therefore infinite, but the game play is concentrated around the center of the map where the player spawns in. The game was developed and tested under Linux with a keyboard. At one point it mostly worked with a controller, but that appears to have fallen apart, so be careful if you attempt to use a controller. The very first version put up for release is quite meager, and is primarily an example of some things that I could do with Unity months ago. The terrain is infinite, and I added land mines to what the Unity FPS Microgame provided to me. There is a sniper rifle somewhat near the player start location, but it is defended by a turret with a high vantage point. The turrets tend to aim badly, so if you stand still and far away they will always miss you. The smaller robots don't patrol, they just wait to see you then move in to kill you.",0,0.0,0,827,0,True,2021

Control the passenger flow! The game features an advanced passenger flow system. All the cities are real, and their population is like in their real analogues. The more population is the more people would like to fly somewhere. Each passenger has their own destination and they’ll fly with transfers if there’re no direct routes. You won’t have enough money to connect each city to all the other cities, so you’ll have to analyze the situation and make decisions about where the transport hub is going to be situated. Just like planes, airports have their maximum capacity. You’ll lose even if one of them gets overloaded. The whole world is your playing field! Almost 200 countries and tens of thousands of cities all around the globe are available to you! You can build an airport in each city and begin transporting passengers. Different locations mean that you’ll have to adapt: while in Europe distances are small and it’s very easy to manage your network there, you’ll have to think about connecting distanced cities because the longer the route is, the more you’ll have to pay for opening it. Different game modes – “Unlock all countries” and Challenges Your task in “Unlock all countries” is to open every country in the world (it will cost you in-game money to unlock each of them) and cover the whole planet with your network. It is necessary to unlock a new country each 6 minutes, or you’ll lose. Challenges are various scenarios with certain pre-set conditions and goals to reach. For example, to survive for some period of time or to earn specific amount of money. Each challenge is unique: in some of them you’ll have to quickly connect constantly unlocking airports, while in the other – to rebuild your network due to coronavirus outbreak in a country. Random events won’t let you get bored Sometimes, random events will occur. They can be positive (investments into your company, for example), negative (disasters blocking flights to some countries or from them), and even ridiculous (a businessman sued you because of spilled coffee in turbulence zone).

Unlike the rest of our solitaire games, we did not invent Nerts. We learned about it from our artist Kyle, who has played it for years, and started playing it after lunch in the Zachtronics office. Over time we added more to it, including house rules, longer tournaments, and even a theme song. When we started working from home in early 2020 we made a rough version of the game to play over the internet, which eventually (nine months later) was cleaned up and turned into this. The game includes a few Zachtronics additions, like players being allowed to move cards between their Nerts pile and their tableau after Nerts has been called. It's free, but you do technically unlock card backs by owning our other games, so let's pretend that's a legitimate monetization strategy.

Using the right type of defensive action with the right timing will drastically reduce or even outright negate damage; all whilst building your combo chain. Exploit the enemy's shifting weaknesses - as they use one of 3 defensive stances, use the right type of attack to drastically increase your damage and gain a combo chain. Each of your attacks will inflict some kind of status effect, allowing you to weaken your enemy, or exploiting applied statuses to create further effects. Spend your combo chain for devastating attacks; the bigger the combo chain, the greater the impact! Story / Exploration: In the final days of humanity, you take up arms as Lennecia Britannia, the First Knight of the Angelic Empire of Britannia. The Moon has opened up, revealing the Eldritch horror within. Chunks of the shattered Moon are on a collision course with Earth, threatening to cleanse all life from the surface.

It's a game that combines the elements of survival horror: Fear, Stealth, Exploration/Puzzle solving, and Item management. This is the 'all-inclusive' game experience that packs in all the elements of survival horror. The 'Multiple First-Person Views', which is a feature of this game, will bring a new level of fear, immersion, and strategy to survival horror. Will you be able to survive from the closed and abandoned house? ■STORY As a new virus spreads across the world. In the suburbs of Westbridge City, there have been a series of disappearances. The protagonist slips and falls while hiking in the mountains outside Westbridge and loses consciousness. When he wakes up, he finds himself in the courtyard of an abandoned house. What awaits the protagonist in the abandoned house? ■Multiple First-Person Views Subjective gameplay that elicits fear. The view you can see is not only that of the main character. You can see the view of 'something' lurking in the abandoned house. The 'Multiple' viewpoints create an even more terrifying and immersive experience. [Main Character's View] [Enemy's View] ■Random Roaming (Random enemy wandering) Enemies' roaming routes are not necessarily constant. The randomness of roaming makes enemy behavior difficult to grasp. Enemy behavior that changes according to the player's actions and story progression. In the abandoned mansion, you cannot allow yourself to be distracted from start to finish. ■Multiple Endings The ending will change depending on the player's actions. Will you be able to find a route to survival? ■Fear A deformed creature lurks in an abandoned mansion. Fear of confronting the enemy in an enclosed space. Fear that you can only escape. And the fear is accelerated by the ability 'Steal Vision' to see the vision of others. ■Stealth It is impossible to survive unless you use 'Steal Vision' to see the vision of creature and act without being detected. It is also useful to find a place to hide and lay low. Creatures also have a sense of hearing and will react to footsteps and doors opening and closing. You need to act in such a way that they cannot see you or hear you. ■Exploration / Puzzle Solving The stage of this game is a closed abandoned house. You must explore every corner of the abandoned mansion to obtain items and solve various mysteries. ■Item Management There is a limit to the number of items a player can carry. The player must decide what items to carry and what items to leave behind, and act efficiently. There is also a limit to the number of consumable items, such as healing potions, that can be obtained. It is also important to conserve the consumable items. There are also items that can be used to resist the enemy or create diversions. You must make full use of a variety of items to escape from this extreme situation. ■Amplification of fear and immersion through sound The effective background music and 3D sound amplify the sense of fear and immersion. For those who want to enjoy the horror atmosphere, it is recommended to darken the screen and use headphones so as not to feel stressed. ■Multiple Difficulty Modes This game has multiple difficulty modes (EASY, NORMAL, HARD, MAD), which differ in terms of enemy strength and the number of items available for consumption.

Probably the most exciting feature is the custom maps support with its many additional settings for the maps to give you even more freedom to come up with crazy stuff. Fight for that Ball also comes with Steam Remote Play support, a target practice mode to improve your timing and shooting skills, a couple of team statistics and achievements. Background Even if it does not look like much, I started work on that game a while ago. After my friends and I had some fun matches in a similar minigame back then, I thought it would be fun to have it a bit faster and more maps. Here we are six years later, a fast football platformer where you can bring your own drawings to shape the map. I enjoy the wacky ball physics and strange fights, so I hope that some of you can have the same fun. I'm thrilled to see what maps you come up with. So, please share your maps, thoughts or experiences over in the Steam Community section. Create custom maps You can create your own Fight for that Ball custom maps with two steps. The base layer is a PNG file containing the stage colliders. Every part of the image that is not white will be seen as a collider. The background should be white or transparent. The next layer is a JSON file for advanced map options to move and rotate goals, move player or ball spawn points. Custom maps must be stored in '%userprofile%/Appdata/LocalLow/Beardman Studios/fightforthatball/CustomMaps/'. Fight for that Ball comes with a custom map guide. You can find all files in the custom maps directory under CustomMapGuide. Both files must have the same name, E.g. test.png and test.json. The JSON file is not required. The game would load the default positions for goals and spawn points if no JSON file was found. Stay safe! &lt;3",2,9.98,2,956,8,True,2021

Instead, those who read these books see what the authors themselves imagined. It is within this Great Library that the protagonist, Felix, makes a deal with the reaper Shifa: if he can show her the difference between romance in the worlds of fiction she's lived through, and how romance plays out in reality, she'll allow him to add a single book to the Library's collection. With a newfound hope, Felix accepts the deal so that he can add a single book to the library: the diary of his late girlfriend. Will he move on and find a new partner, or will he find the ending he's always wanted for himself? The choice will be yours as you explore the lives of students at Lilia Matsumoto University to satisfy the reaper watching over your life, all so you can find true love! Though, that's only if you make the best choices, and being able to trade your lifespan for all the knowledge in the universe might not be the best idea... In Once More, you'll be able to foster relationships and maybe fall in love (or out of love!) depending on how you interact with the characters. Unfortunately, love takes work, and Felix is going to have to prove his love is true if he wants to reclaim the happiness he once lost. Characters You'll be wearing the shoes of Felix, our unlucky protagonist who has made a deal with death itself. Whether or not he's able to move on and reclaim the happiness he once held is entirely up to you, so please take good care of him. His personality is very subdued, but if you can help him meet the right people he may just find himself again. Shifa is a reaper who works in the Great Library, where she categorizes every text written throughout history. Her tendency to act like the main character of the last book she read comes from her current dilemma of being unable to tell fiction from reality, the former of which is her only understanding of Felix's world. Mima used to be Felix's girlfriend, but a great tragedy separated them. In order to reclaim the future he never got to have with her, Felix has decided to make a deal with the reaper Shifa in order to one day see her again should he be unable to move on.

Her passion for film is what motivates her as she sets out to find her own goals in life, even if hindered by her past ones.

She wanted to possess a cloud, to have one for herself. But clouds float and travel in the sky, and they are always changing their form. Sometimes they look like an overcoat, sometimes like a horse. Because of the nature of impermanence within the clouds, the River suffered very much. Her pleasure, her joy had become just chasing after clouds, one after another, but despair, anger, and hatred became her life. Then one day a strong wind came and blew away all the clouds in the sky. The sky became completely empty.... That night was the first opportunity for her to hear her own crying, the sounds of water crashing against the banks of the River. Because she was able to listen to her own voice, she discovered something quite important. She realized that what she had been looking for was already in herself. She found out that clouds are nothing but water. Clouds are born from water and will return to water. And she found out she herself was also water... When she opened her heart completely to the evening sky she received the image of the full Moon - beautiful, round, like a jewel within herself... The fresh and beautiful Moon is traveling in the utmost empty sky. When the mind-rivers of living beings are free, that image of the beautiful Moon will reflect in each of us. This was the mind of the river at that moment. She received the image of that beautiful Moon within her heart, and water, clouds, and the Moon took each other's hands and practiced walking meditation slowly, slowly to the ocean...' Part 3 'Pebble Meditation' is inspired by Zen Master Thich Nhat Hanh: “Breathing in, I see myself as a flower. Breathing out, I feel fresh. Breathing in, I see myself as a mountain. Breathing out, I feel solid. Breathing in, I see myself as still water. Breathing out, I reflect things as they truly are. Breathing in, I see myself as space.

The player takes the role of a vagrus - a caravan leader who strives to survive in a strange and dangerous dark fantasy world by leading a traveling company on all kinds of ventures. A vast realm is yours to explore, filled with unique locations, strange factions, and a colorful cast of characters. In order to punish the Empire for its sins, the Elder Gods unleashed their power a thousand years ago that ended up devastating the realms. The continent is now a wasteland, riddled with arcane anomalies, swarming with twisted monsters, and haunted by roaming undead even after long centuries of rebuilding. A large selection of stories make up the game’s narrative in the form of events and quests. The choices you make in these often affect your companions and the world around you. Pick your background from trader, mercenary, or explorer; work for factions, follow rumors and trading opportunities; acquire wealth, gain fame, and discover hidden knowledge. Engage in turn-based, tactical combat that involves your companions and a large variety of enemies, both humanoid and monstrous.

Journeys have to be planned and prepared for carefully, lest they end in disaster. Manage your supplies, morale, and your crew’s vigor effectively to survive. Haul cargo and valuables across the wasteland or take it from others. Your crew of workers, fighters, scouts, and slaves have to be managed well to optimize their effectiveness.

Whether the game is fun is the only criterion for supporting it. 1.0 The process is short, even after customs clearance, there is still time to refund. Thank you for your attention and tolerance. I will continue to work hard to let everyone witness my progress. The reason for selling this version Hello everyone, I am an independent game producer.Airtight City 1.0 is my maiden game work. This game landed on the Steam platform for a free trial one and a half years ago. Won a relatively good game evaluation. But more importantly, the various problems exposed in the game gave me a deep understanding of the serious shortcomings of my own ability. I did not choose to continue developing this novice-level work. Instead, it made a series of very bold or irrational decisions. I archived most of the content of this project, and only extracted its main program architecture. And started a new round of development process. Project Airtight City 2.0 In the next 15 months, [1] I refactored more than 50% of the core code in the game, so that the internal stability and scalability of the game have been significantly improved. [2] Learned modeling and material production from scratch, and rebuilt all scene models in the game. Try to get rid of the cheap splicing texture of independent 3D games. [3] Refactored the game's plot setting and planning copywriting, allowing the game to obtain more original content. [4] 100% refactoring and upgrading have been carried out for the operation feel / shooting feel / light and shadow effect / interface design. Today's Airtight City 2.0 project has completed 90% of the main function production, and part of the scene construction. Laying out the game plot will be the main work direction for the next one to two years. Through more than a year of project reconstruction and systematic learning. At this time, both the game effect and my ability itself have been qualitatively improved. However, no matter how full the ideal is, it must be reflected in the reality. My development funds have been exhausted. It's hard to maintain my development career. So I can only sell this little game on the Steam platform, hoping to generate some income and help me maintain my dream. Hope this can help me through the difficulties.

41774,Would you like to run an idol café? 2,2021-09-27,9.99,0,StarlightTree Games,Winged Cloud,Simulation,"In this Visual Novel Yokoyama Naoya works as a waiter a small seaside café owned by the flirtatious Miss Miyamori. Alongside his co-workers, the serious Mayuki and the spacey Kuu, Naoya is happy to while away his days with honest labor... At least, until he learns that The Seaside Café is in the red, and runs the risk of closing. Wanting to save the café from being shuttered, Naoya turns to his childhood friend, Ichigo, for advice. After giving the predicament some thought, Ichigo decides that what The Seaside Café is lacking is its own idol group. Bright, shining, sparkling idols should be more than enough to rescue the café from obscurity, and bring about a huge influx in potential customers! Ichigo enlists Kuu and Mayuki's help, and together they form an idol unit to represent The Seaside Café: Sweet Shoreline. Things seem to be going well, but there are a few snags with Ichigo's wonderful plan. Firstly, Mayuki and Kuu have no experience singing and dancing - and secondly, there's a rival idol group in town, Honey Devil, who seem determined to undermine all of Sweet Shoreline's efforts. Will Sweet Shoreline be able to succeed, or will they self-destruct before accomplishing their noble goals? That's for Naoya's actions to determine! Suzuki Ichigo is Naoya's childhood friend. She's a cheerful, bubbly girl with no shortage of energy. She's almost perpetually optimistic, but she has a bad habit of pushing herself. She has a tendency to take on more work than she should, and Naoya often worries that she'll burn herself out. Ichigo acts as the leader of Sweet Shoreline. She adores idols herself, being a huge fan of Hoshizora Shiori, and works tirelessly on polishing her singing and dancing. Shinonome Mayuki is a serious girl Naoya first met when he began to work at The Seaside Café. Though he and Mayuki got off to a rocky beginning, after he accidentally tripped her on his first shift, Mayuki soon softens towards him. Mayuki might act uppity and aloof, but this is largely a veneer to hide her own lack of self-confidence. She's a shy girl who worries how others will perceive her, and while undoubtedly gifted at academics, she's lacking when it comes to common sense. Yamashiro Kuina, known to her friends as Kuu, works as a waitress at The Seaside Café. She rarely speaks or smiles, but she isn't shy: she's prone, instead, to getting lost in her own world. Kuu is a close friend of Mayuki's, and the pair have known one another since preschool. Mayuki might be Kuu's only friend, in fact, for the other waitresses at The Seaside Café tend to keep their distance. Kuu has a vested interest in fortune-telling, but the fortunes she often tells are steeped in mundane misery. She talks about macabre subjects often, has truly bizarre tastes in 'music', and when she does speak, it's to utter unnerving portents about the future which make Naoya shudder. Enoshima Rina is an elegant, demure young lady who works as a waitress at Café Pleiades. She forms one half of the popular idol unit Honey Devil, alongside her friend Hasaki. Rina's mannerisms are unfailingly polite, yet behind her demure smile there lurks something unsettlingly sadistic. She seems to have taken quite a liking to Naoya, and keeps trying to pursue him, much to Naoya's unease. Ebihara Hasaki is a gothic girl who fancies herself as 'the dark one', and a servant of 'The Dark Lord'. Like Rina, she works as a waitress at Café Pleiades, and makes up the second member of the idol duo Honey Devil. Hasaki is an attractive girl, as far as appearances go, but her personality leaves much to be desired. She talks like she inhabits a different reality to everybody else, and perhaps she does. Trying to understand her ramblings is a hassle liable to induce headaches, and the best way to deal with her would be to ignore her.",10,99.9,8,825,14,True,2021

22079,Schizm: Mysterious Journey,2021-10-08,8.99,0,DETALION,LK Avalon,Adventure,"​ SCHIZM: Mysterious Journey ​ JUST LIKE FINDING THE MARY CELESTE You are about to participate in a great adventure. It is the year 2083. Ten months ago, the first humans landed on Argilus. They found cities, towns, industrial installations - all deserted. Doors unlocked. Meals unfinished. Amazing machinery still working. But no people. It was like finding the Mary Celeste on a planetary scale. ​ LIVING SHIPS, FLOATING CITIES, A FASCINATING MYSTERY Science teams were brought in, research bases set up. Four months later, your supply ship has been sent to check on these bases. But when you hail them from orbit, there's no answer. The science teams, too, seem to have vanished. Now your systems are failing and you and your crewmate have no choice but to abandon ship. But where can you go? Where else? SCHIZM: MYSTERIOUS JOURNEY is a thrilling First Contact adventure where you play both members of the Earth supply vessel Angel as you explore the fascinating landscape of an alien world filled with mystery and intrigue . On 4 December 1872, the 103-foot brigantine Mary Celeste was discovered drifting abandoned in the Atlantic 590 miles west of Gibraltar. The captain's log and the crew's personal effects were found on board. The cargo was intact. There was an unfinished letter on the mate's desk, the imprint of a child's head on a pillow on one of the bunks. To this day, no one knows what became of the captain, his family and the crew of seven. When the first humans landed on Argilus on 24 June 2083, they found towns, cities, evidence of fascinating alien technology, but all abandoned, with clear signs that the inhabitants had only just departed. Doors were unlocked, meals unfinished. Amazing machinery was still working away. But no people. It was like discovering the Mary Celeste on a planetary scale. Earth Central wanted answers. The planet was classified Restricted and put under immediate quarantine. Experts were sent in. Three science teams - nearly a hundred of Earth's finest first contact specialists - set up science and monitoring outposts at three promising locations: Base One at Bosh's Tunnels, under Dr Angela Davies, Base Two at Symphony Harbor, under Dr Gustav Tomlin, and Base Three at Rainbow Landing, under Dr Frances Bremmer. Because of a particularly active planetary magnetosphere, the surface teams found it impossible to contact Earth directly. Though able to make limited radio contact with one another, the constant electromagnetic interference in the atmosphere prevented messages being routed through the orbital beacon in the usual manner. At first, eager mission leaders could use shuttles to return to the orbiting expedition base ship, Tarquin, and broadcast from there, but twenty days after the expedition's arrival, Tarquin fell silent and vanished from surface radar scans. It had either left the area or - an alarming prospect - had been destroyed in orbit. The teams on Argilus were effectively cut off from Earth. That was just the beginning. Scientists began to go missing. One by one, wherever they were working, alone or in company, personnel at all three bases started disappearing. Was it something they touched, some device they activated, some secret they discovered? No one could say. Every day, the survivors were faced with the nightmare of discovering who had vanished this time, and were left frantically, desperately, uselessly seeking answers. Now, four months later, the mission supply ship Angel approaches Argilus to make the first follow-up contact, but its crew - experienced spacers and xeno specialists Sam Mainey and Hannah Grant - can't raise any response from the planetary bases. There is no sign at all of the expedition mothership. Knowing that communication from the surface is difficult, and following special ECS mission directives, Captain Mainey takes Angel into a much closer orbit than usual, to where Angel's enhanced com systems should be able to raise someone. There's still no response. Bounceback signatures are positive. Com systems seem to be online and operational, but no-one answers. It's as if the Earth science teams have simply vanished. Sam and Hannah know what they must do. Given the circumstances, standard ECS procedure is to abort the landing, withdraw to a safe distance and await instructions. But the moment they try to pull back to where they can notify Earth of what has happened, Angel's main systems fail. Com and engines are out. Life support is falling to critical. The ship's orbit is beginning to decay. Sam Mainey and Hannah Grant have no choice but to use the life-pods and abandon ship, even though they have not yet received the classified 902 mission briefing they were meant to get once contact with the scientists had been made. ​ STRANGE NEW WORLD Though Sam and Hannah agree to rendezvous at Base One, and adjust their life-pods' comp systems accordingly, weather and electromagnetic variables cause them to land quite some distance from each other, so their first exposure to the new world finds them on their own. Hannah lands on a fascinating living ship adrift in the middle of the Great Northern Ocean, and Sam on one of a cluster of balloons floating high above one of the continents. Though their radio links are operational, they both quickly find that the atmospheric interference makes communication impossible. They set their links on record, both as a routine mission log for those back home and in case their missing crewmate can access the data later. Then, with no other choice, they begin exploring this strange new world. With Sam and Hannah, you will experience every step of this fascinating journey of discovery, face their problems, share their successes and disappointments. With luck and skill, you might even unlock the ultimate mystery of Argilus. ONLY YOU CAN UNLOCK THE SECRET!

The screen resolution is fixed at 1024 by 768 and best played in a windowed mode. A full screen executable is included in the game's installation folder; it will stretch to fit wide screen monitors. Incudes: Cults of the Wasteland and Tip of the Spear expansions. Armageddon Empires is a computer turn based strategy game that takes the best elements of collectable card games (don’t worry there are no cards to chase you get them all), board games, and computer games and brings them all together to provide a unique interactive strategy war game experience. You can choose a normal size map and battle in a death match with a single AI opponent finishing within an hour or select a huge map and slug it out with the other 3 factions in a game of epic proportions. Players start by choosing one of four factions and building their playing decks. Each faction has its own play-style, strengths and weaknesses. There are 7 main card types: Heroes, Units, Facilities, Attack (Aircraft, Helo/Hover and Missile), Attachments, Munitions, Tactics. The game map is created randomly each time you play and seeded with resources and independent units and facilities. Your cards are played by drawing on your resource stockpiles. 4 basic resources are necessary to build your empire in the harsh new world. Humans, Materials, Energy and Technology are all strewn across the playing board. Some are concentrated in the ruins of human cities; others are found in the junk heaps of forgotten battlefields or simply lying buried in the vast wastes. Once the game is underway, you will want to deploy your heroes and units and explore the map. Some hexes will contain resources; some will harbor independents. These units and facilities range from human slavers, raiders and mercenaries to alien warlords, rogue machine masterminds and mutated monsters. Depending on your faction some will offer to join your cause (maybe for a price) while others will fight you to the death. With the map scouted out, your enemies located and your armies formed up, you will want to unleash the dogs of war. Everything costs Action Points, so plan your moves well. You might want to use some air power to soften up the enemy first. Attack cards are played from your hand and can strike enemy armies within range of your stronghold and outposts. Drag the Aircraft, Missile or Helo (Hover Ship) card and drop it on an enemy formation and the battle is joined. Your card’s attack strength is represented by die on the horizontal rolling area. The target’s defense strength is represented below yours by the die on the lower rolling area. Each die has 3 sides with the faction’s symbol denoting a success and 3 sides that are blank denoting failure. Both players roll their dice, count up their successes and then try and modify the results. Some aircraft as well as all heroes have fate points they can spend to re-roll Air to groundany die that failed. Tactic cards can be played to drastically change the results…add positive die to your pool, re-roll opponent’s die, turn them to failures, or even remove them. If the attacker rolls higher than the defender then the difference is applied as damage. Armies are represented by rectangular playing pieces on the board. Each army can contain 1 hero and up to 8 units (cards) but you will have to be careful not to exceed your hero’s command rating or their attack, defense and movement will suffer. When two non-stealthed armies meet in a hex a battle ensues. These battles can encompass multiple stacks of armies so you are first given the chance to determine the order in which they will fight. Battles are army versus army until one side is destroyed, gutted (only a leader remains) or retreated by their owner. The player remaining on the battle field with a combat capable army is the winner and gains control of the hex. Any surviving defeated units are subjected to a retreat attack if they opted to retreat and their heroes may be captured or killed in the rout. Capturing enemy heroes is particularly advantageous as they are interred in the nearest friendly stronghold or outpost and generate 1 bonus Action Point per player turn. Ground Combat is a brutal affair. Just like air attacks, your card’s attack strength is represented by die on the horizontal rolling area. The target’s defense strength is represented below yours by the die on the lower rolling area. Both players roll their die, count the successes and then try and modify the results. If the attack roll is greater than the defense roll then the difference is applied as damage to the defender. Once a unit attacks or performs a special ability it is marked as committed and may not take any further actions until the next round. Players take turns attacking or playing abilities until the end of the round is reached. Both players then have the chance to assess the situation and either withdraw the currently active armyground combat (each unit is subjected to a free attack), retreat all armies (again a free attack is taken as well as a capture/kill attempt for any heroes without units in their army) or continue the fight. If both sides elect to retreat than no free attacks are taken. To win the struggle for the wasteland you must occupy or destroy each of your enemies’ strongholds. It sounds simple enough but there are many paths to achieve that objective. You can wage a brutal straight forward ground campaign, develop a secret weapon in your laboratories and vaporize your enemy, or use stealth and sabotage to eliminate your enemy. The choice is up to you but keep in mind your enemies will be moving against you as well. All it takes is one good nuke to ruin your day.",24,239.76,17,989,0,True,2021

But a run-in with a sexy vampire groupie turned his thirst for love into a thirst for blood! Rick uses a deadly shotgun to blast the bad guys to bits. He’s also working on a comeback album. Nosferadude No one knows how old Nosferadude is, or where he comes from, or even if “he” is a he. But one thing is clear, Nosferadude is agile and a dangerous predator. He collects more blood than anyone else on the team, making his vampire rage even more deadly! Squirt Every team needs a mascot, and Squirt is the bat with the can-do attitude that makes the team go!

Game Masters need not purchase the 'Game Master' DLC upon release, but it will be required upon leaving early access. The DLC will however be available as a pay-if-you-want way to support the development of Dudes during early access. Dudes on a Map aims to be the easiest way of taking ANY Tabletop RPG online, and works great for digital mapping at the table as well. With a streamlined set of tools for sharing maps of any kind, along with streamlined automation for managing initiative, a customizable dice systems to support a variety of game systems, and a minimalistic approach to both player and non-player characters in the system. This feature-lite approach to online play may seem barebones when compared to similar systems, however it also affords the Game Master a much more flexible approach to running games, by not locking the game into any specific rules-systems or stat blocks, and letting you simply tell the story you want to tell without investing time and money learning how to work with API's, huge configuration blocks, modding, map triggers, complex lighting and on and on. The feature-lite approach also means that the user interface doesn't need to cram in all those extra features, making it much easier to learn and much easier to find the things you're looking for in the midst of the game. This lighter interface also allows for things like multiple players sharing a device (or the whole party even) , hybrid games where some players are present at the table while others join via the internet, viewing a second screen of the DM's (or one of those sweet tabletop-TV's), or streaming the player window to a mobile device to reveal the map as the players explore. Simple system to turn any digital image into a playable map for any tabletop RPG Flexible design keeps the GM in charge, not the computer. Easy to learn for the GM and the players Players setup takes just a few minutes, no special preparations for digital-play. Paper sheets work just fine here. Digital images can be converted to playable, gridded, maps in minutes once you learn the ropes, including features to match existing grids on your image. Map anything: dungeons, cantinas, countries, continents, planets, star charts, or concept-maps. Support for square grids as well as horizontal and vertical hexagonal grids , or use a simple distance scale, or no scale at all. Targeted automation to keep online games running smooth without overloading the GM Customizable dice system supports numeric and symbol-based dice. Simple initiative system minimizes the time it takes to run combats and supports a number of options for standard and symbolic dice. Works well on low bandwidth connections (but maps may take some time to send). Connect the way you want: self-hosting , LAN, (*experimental) public servers , or single-PC (for mapping at the table) are all supported. Own your data. Nothing stored online, no content limits, no arbitrary player limits, no accounts. No up-selling.

Defend your flock of sheep and goats from wild animals using a variety of items and weapons. Migrate through beautiful procedurally generated pastures, selling livestock, milk, and wool to passing trade caravans. Keep your flock happy and healthy to continue breeding, milking, and shearing. Cash out at any time and take home your earnings, or continue the nomadic lifestyle until you're so far into the wild that your flock succumbs to predators, starvation, or disease. Keep in mind this is a simple game by a tiny studio. You can expect a fun engaging experience that you can play for a couple of hours each session, or simply pick up and play casually. This game offers: Beautiful procedural alpine landscapes, the sounds of sheep on pasture, and wind in the meadows. Action packed gameplay, or the alternative relaxing casual mode. A unique mix of resource management strategy and third-person action-tower-defense. A friendly herding dog companion. Starting out: You begin the game with enough cash to start a small flock. Your sheep and goats will happily graze on grass and wildflowers until they've eaten everything in the area, at which point you'll need to move to the next pasture. At the start of each new pasture, you'll have time to set up your map with defensive items before you open the gate and let your livestock out. Each successive pasture moves further into the wild, increasing your encounters with wild animals, and decreasing the frequency at which trade caravans arrive. Caravans are your place to sell the wool, milk, or livestock you've grown over the seasons, as well as buy new items or animals to continue your herding adventure. You'll see your flock grow as the seasons change, watching for bears in the autumn, taking care to feed your flock hay in the winter, and birthing new lambs in the springtime. When you sell off your whole flock, or if your flock is wiped out by wild animals or disease, your final cash is saved as your high score. At this point you can start again in a fresh new meadow with a new flock and a new strategy.

But, to ease their labor they knew they would need help. So, using powerful magic imbued into orbs they formed the first humans from the elements. Some of these humans would serve the Anura with the utmost devotion, even venerating the Anura as gods in some localities, while others chose to decide their own fate and formed their own villages &amp; cities throughout Sylvenus. When the Dracon from the moon Fengari saw the power the Anura had to create life, they decided to come to Earth &amp; learn from this magic from them. Eventually, the Anura &amp; Dracon became close allies and together they would set up kingdoms in Sylvenus. These kingdoms are known collectively to this day as the Sylvenian Empire. The Empire would be ruled over by the Archon, who carried genes from both humans &amp; the Dracon - created by powerful Draconian arcanists after learning the ancient magic of the Anura. Their servants would be the humans who, in return for gifts, would mine gold &amp; collect other rare resources for the Archon. Because of their affinity for the arcane arts, the Anura became priests &amp; priestesses of The Moon Cult who seek to preserve ancient knowledge &amp; uphold the power of the Empire. After many years of service to the Archon a war broke out between some of the humans &amp; the Archon rulers. All those rebels who rose up against their power were sentenced to exile or made guardians of the Archons' homelands. A high-ranking member of The Moon Cult called The Oracle placed a powerful curse on the rebels, turning them into creatures who transform at night: Vampire, Werewolf, Salamander &amp; Cyclops. Humans living within the Empire's borders are taught to shun these creatures, and they are generally considered outcasts by most - living in exile or as refugees. Your journey begins in Castle Odium where you have been recruited for the Empire. You have no knowledge of what happened before, only that your duty is to help the King and the Royal Court. Discover your past &amp; forge your destiny as the story unfolds in the mystical lands of Sylvenus. Travel through the world of Sylvenus defeating enemies &amp; leveling your character.

However, the forces of the Demon Lord Alrolloth were unable to defeat the Guardians of Greenheart. After this bitter defeat, Alrolloth returned to the hell where he was born and waited for revenge. With each passing day, the hatred in him grew bigger and bigger, and he nurtured that hatred into a loathsome force within himself. And hope came to Alrolloth when he discovered the Orcs. With his demonic powers, he tempts the Orcs to become the most bloodthirsty warriors and serve his legion. After ten thousand years of waiting, the Demon Lord Alrolloth and his bloodthirsty Orc warriors have returned to Greenheart.

In addition to her superb archery skills, Lyraesel was also known as a brilliant commander and dedicated trainer. Under her command are other elite rangers with excellent archery skills just like her. Ygannea - Assassin Born and raised in Greenheart, Ygannea trained to be a master assassin.

With her rare talent, Ygannea is tasked with finding and training other talented elves to become master assassins like her. Selena - Warrior Selena is the Champion of the kingdom of Lusnistan.

However, to assassinate a Grand Marshal like Elissa is not easy, alarm bells rang, all soldiers gathered and killed the assassins. But it didn't stop there, when the attention of the guards was all on the assassins, Orc warriors from all sides appeared and attacked Elissa's camp.

47709,Wyvern,2021-03-09,0.0,0,Ghost Track Inc,Ghost Track Inc,"Indie,Massively Multiplayer,RPG,Early Access","Wyvern is an Indie, old-school graphical MMO-RPG, inspired by games like Gauntlet, Nethack, and Ultima IV. Wyvern is a huge and diverse world: the game has been around 20+ years and is in continuous development. We are excited to bring the game to Steam, with new features and content. Gameplay The game features a top-down, tiled-based 2D view, with real-time combat and adventuring. An important part of the gameplay is the text output area, on the right. The game tells you in text what's happening, and you can also see chat messages and other information there. The game window also includes views of your spells, your inventory, your stats, custom views for other situations. Wyvern is a command-oriented game: There are hundreds of commands you can type: social commands and emotes, appraising and crafting, inventory management and more. You can bind commands to hotkeys using your entire keyboard. You can even create custom commands using aliases and macros to speed up your gameplay. The command system gives Wyvern unprecedented depth, power, and flexibility. Features Some of Wyvern's rich, exciting features include: 17 unique player races, from humans and elves, to fighting cats, giants, vampires and more Over 50 quests, many of them quite elaborate, with their own unique and powerful rewards A Builder Mode (level editor) that anyone can use to create their own areas A Guild system that allows you to further specialize and fine-tune your character's abilities Over 100 unique spells that can be learned, or used from wands, rods and magic items Hundreds of playable areas, from cities and towns, to crypts, dungeons, ruins, underwater realms, and much more Over 500 monsters that can wield weapons, cast spells, fire missiles, use wands, etc. And your summoned creatures can do all that too! A popular Random Dungeon system that provides endless levels of monsters and loot Player groups, support roles, and adventuring facilities Raid bosses, Live Quests, and other endgame events Custom images: At 25th level, you can upload your own avatars to fully personalize your character A well-established and friendly community of helpful old-timer players It's hard to do justice to the size and scope of Wyvern until you've played it yourself. Physics Even though Wyvern is a 2D tile-based game, it still supports a rich set of physical properties, including: A rich lighting model and a day/night cycle Missiles, projectiles, throwables, and area-of-effect spells Pushable objects, levers and gates, vehicles, mechanical traps, and other active objects Over a dozen damage types with resistances, immunities, and vulnerabilities A built-in side-scroller engine with gravity, friction and other effects, for certain quests and areas A sophisticated camera system that allows scrying, wizard-eye, detect-monsters and much more A realistic body-parts system - e.g., a hydra (naga) player can wear five helmets and five amulets Audio effects and background music The game engine has thousands of different objects to support the game, the economy, quests, missions, guilds, and other features you would expect from a fun MMO. Cross-Platform and Cross-Play Wyvern for Steam currently supports Windows. You can also play on Mac and Linux, but you must download those clients from the Ghost Track website. We expect to support Linux and Mac on Steam in the near future. The Mac and Linux versions support cross-play with the Windows version. Wyvern also runs on Android and iOS, on both phones and tablets. All the supported platforms (Steam/Windows, Mac, Linux, Android, iOS) share the same backend servers. You can hop off your Steam client and onto your mobile client, or vice-versa, without even leaving the game. Your account will work across all devices, including new clients we add in the future. When you play Wyvern from Steam, you can log straight into the game and start creating characters and playing. If you want to play your characters on mobile as well, then you can link a Gmail account to your Steam account, and they will act like a single account. You use the Gmail account for logging into non-Steam Wyvern clients. On iOS we also support Sign in with Apple and Log in with Facebook, but these do not support account linking. Free to Play Wyvern prides itself in NOT being a pay-to-win (p2w) game. The game runs on Cloud servers, which costs us money. We have opted for a free-to-play model, where, if you like, you can purchase Wyvern Crowns as the in-game currency. Many players do this simply to show their support of the game they love so much. But we also offer perks and conveniences if you buy Crowns. Here are some examples: You can get early access to a custom image for your character. You can convert Crowns to gold (based on your experience level) if you find yourself in a cash crunch. VIPs can transfer items between their characters. You can buy a Private Jet that saves you travel time. In general, we do not have unlockable areas, although VIPs who purchase a certain number of Crowns get access to a special lounge, a 20% off store, and a couple of other minor perks. But 99.99% of the game is available to everyone. Our philosophy is pay for convenience , as long as it does not give you an unfair competitive edge. The highest level you can achieve in the game today is Demigod (level 50), and quite a few of them have never spent money on Wyvern. They played completely for free and made it as high as you can go, and in fact they are quite competitive -- because this is not a P2W game. Wyvern is a tiny development team: Just one developer, plus a handful of volunteers. We strongly believe that Wyvern should be free and fair for people who don't want to spend money supporting us. Learning Curve Unfortunately, Wyvern has a steep learning curve. It is a complex game with decades of history. Our getting-started experience needs some love. There is a starting tutorial, and we are working to improve it. But it takes some patience to learn the fundamentals of the game. But we hope you will give it a try! Because once you're over that learning curve, a truly amazing game awaits you. There are active players, some of them online as you are reading this, who have been playing Wyvern since 2002. And plenty of new players who have discovered the joy and challenge and inspiration of Wyvern, which is like almost no other game on Earth.",94,0.0,37,1027,0,True,2021

Our protagonist wakes up in a strange world looking for answers. He learns that he has died and returned to the realm as a spirit. The only way he can find his way back to the living is to find the Rift Keeper. He soon learns that the world is being overrun by creatures and demons entering through the Rift. The people of the realm need him, but so does his family. One thing that I tried to focus on was to have NPC characters explain or tell little bits of the story. So, even though it is not necessary always for completing a level, the players might find it useful and hopefully interesting to chat to the NPC characters! Some NPC characters will be able to join you and help you fight your way through hoards of enemies. It will be your task to help heal them. Use TAB to check health and descriptions of enemies. The game features branching dialogue, so if an NPC offers to help you, it is possible to decline his offer. Environments range from mystical forests, dark dungeons, villages, caves and citadels. The goal was to create 'pretty', yet dark and gloomy environments for players to explore. There is even a haunted cemetery with massive hoards of enemies to slash down. There are many items in the game that players can collect in various ways. Find useful items in loot chests or crates throughout the levels. Players can also buy from items from merchants. Some items can be used as powerups when equipped in the character inventory. There are also many weapons to find in the game, however, the player can only have 1 weapon at a time. Along with many items available within the game for players to find in loot chests or crates, there will be items that will be useful in other ways. These seemingly useless items can be taken to a Crafting Altar. Players can then summon potions, weapons or useful items in a random fashion. - Discover the secrets of the new Realm you have woken up in. - Battle your way through branching level design. Play side-quests to earn extra loot and XP. - Discover secret portals and areas that take you to new locations. - Collect items in the game world and use them to craft weapons, potions or items at a Crafting Altar. - Learn to master many different spells. Some more powerful than others. - Colorful, beautiful and vibrant worlds to explore. - Find different types of weapons like swords, spears and maces with varying damage. Use them to crush the beasts entering through the Rift. - Ragdoll physics makes for some fun killing of enemies. - Get NPC characters to join you on your quest and help you fight. - Gain experience and level up from quests and killing enemies to gain more powers and become stronger.

STORY The man who's soon to be a king is seconds from a headlock. All he wants is to live easy and have a good time. At this rate he'll turn into a spineless amoeba, and his childhood friend Hikari won't have it. They hash things out, they talk things over, in the heat of the moment his chest glows with magic— The two of them wake up in a strange seaside city, with no idea how they got there. When a woman who claims to be the country's chancellor greets them, she clears things up: They've been caught in a desperate royal recruitment that happened to involve an inter-world kidnapping. Hurled across dimensions, enthroned without warning, and suddenly the center of national attention... Things are moving fast, and the king's first duty is to get married pronto. “Build a harem around yourself, and spare no pains in the kingdom's development and the propagation of the royal line.” The new king is afraid of love, but he'll have to get over it for his nation's future! New brides appear in quick succession. The princess of a neighboring country, a beautiful noble with a personal interest... As our hero disappears under a pile of women, even his childhood friend dives into the fray...?! “I just want a normal romance!” You're getting five at once. Say hello to the harem! CHARACTERS An inseparable and irrepressible childhood friend who's been with the protagonist since they were young. To the new king, she's the only one he can fully cut loose with, and Hikari is a capable housekeeper to boot. She becomes something of a guardian to him. Equipped with knowledge of beauty and fashion as well, she does take a certain pride in being a woman. In matters of love she finds honesty difficult, but she knows from the start that she's in love with the protagonist. “Yeah, yeah. I'm not gonna flip out over one little touch. I've known you since forever.” A devastating beauty and devilish manipulator, born and raised in a noble house. Char, as she's called, is adorable and brilliant, and maximizes the advantages of being both. Most people she meets end up dancing on her strings. Younger than the others but not by much, on the inside she's all too mature. Char is a daughter of old money, not new; she can't hide the elegance her upbringing instilled. Aggressive in matters of love to a degree that could be called overwhelming. Knowing the male heart all too well, she soon has the protagonist's pounding to her beat. “Hee hee. I think I warned Your Majesty? My love runs deadly deep...” The youngest-ever chancellor of the kingdom of Palretta, this career superwoman shows weakness to no one. She serves the protagonist, her king, with distinction, as his closest aide in official matters. In her eyes, the country far outweighs her own life, and she has no interest in pursuing love. Though imperturbable and unruffled herself, she exhibits considerable kindness and thought for the needs of her new sovereign. Marrou rarely allows herself to show softness, and even after you grow close to her, she's still mostly above it all. “That ought to be enough playing around. You mustn't let me spoil you.” A delicate, lovely, and sheltered princess. She grew up as a beloved symbol of her people's prosperity, and became the protagonist's fiancee by arranged marriage. Her education was strict, so she understands her role well, and has always prioritized it above everything. Therefore, she rarely asserts herself, especially not over others. Her bright personality usually covers it, but underneath she's given up on her own happiness. Meeting with the protagonist changes everything. New values spring up inside Sophia, and in the happiness of her daily life, she gives voice to a more playful side of herself. “I'm so happy I met you, Dearest. No one ever let me be selfish before...” A girl a man can't help wanting to protect. She doesn't speak much, and keeps her heart close. Sold into slavery as a young child, she has few memories of her parents. Intelligent and intuitive, she's devoted to keeping those around her happy, but it's not for a positive reason. She's afraid of being handled cruelly, and desperately afraid of fighting with others. Meeting the protagonist and living with him, she slowly rediscovers her heart-melting smile. “U-Um... am I really... adequate to do such things with you, Master...?” Features A laugh-a-minute visual novel Beautiful art &amp; characters Five adorable heroines Five harem routes based on your relationships with ALL the girls Happy endings for everybody!",55,1649.4499999999998,40,797,0,True,2021

Then if you are skillful enough, you can make your fire! Hardcore survival / player customization - Make sure you forage for that food or grow some crops, for when you die, your character is gone!

Some examples are hunting, fishing, leatherworking and farming. You can also become a master bone, wood, or stone maker to help other people's professions along. Work together with other players to make items faster and stronger. Interact with every item in the world - No more playing a game where trees and rocks are just fancy artwork! You can harvest wood from every tree, and pick up every rock you see! Custom game engine with a massive seamless world - The game uses a custom 3D game engine I created called VantEdit. It generates and renders massively sized worlds of any size I choose, and you get to explore them. Walk in a single direction and you will circumnavigate the globe with no loading screens. The game's current development state: What is completed (of course these will be constantly improved and updated): - The Game's engine: ( rendering/ seamless world mechanics etc ). I have refined the engine to be a great vessel in which to create the game. I have spent years on it and helps to give the game the feel it needed to have. - Game Play Mechanics: The game play system is fully implemented as intended, has been tested and is fully playable. Again this only means that the core elements have been completed and I am of course working on improving all aspects of the game. This includes UI framework, Crafting, Skills and Item design, etc... - Networking conversion: This took many years, but I am proud to say that the online version of the game is fully stable. The game now also supports offline servers (for playing single-player), and player hosted dedicated servers that can be publicly displayed to all players around the world. - The Game's Editor tools: Though this is not currently available to players yet, the game's editor is designed to add in new crafts, items and skills easily into the game, as I develop the game I add in new skills, new items, and new crafts into the game. Even though I call this a primitive survival game, I plan to continue to add new content to the game constantly! What does this mean? Well at a certain point I will add in archery, more complex farming mechanics, more building types etc... What will be added in the near future: - PvP: Once the game has been sufficiently tested, I will be finishing the PvP aspect of the game. - More server hosting options: Players who wish to host servers will be able to customize their servers to more specific needs and preferences (making hardcore-only servers, etc...) - Access to VantEdit world editor: Players will be able to host servers with their own procedural generated worlds. They will have the ability to create nearly any size world with the ability to change temperatures, land and continent formations, and much more. This functionality will be later in development, most likely after the full launch. What can be improved: - Artwork: Many of the graphics you see in game are my own 'programmer art', simple yet useful art I create in a short amount of time. There are works of art done by professionals in the industry as well however. One goal of hopefully getting the game into Early Access is to hire back some of these artists to get the artwork more professional. Future Plans for the Game The content I can continue to add will never stop! I will run out of primitive technologies and keep moving forward, one item, craft, or skill at a time. So how far can I go? Will the game's technology get to the Roman Era? Medieval? Industrial Era? Modern Era? The game is a constantly evolving, ever changing universe that you exist in. It just all depends on people like you who I hope like, support, and enjoy the idea behind this game.",71,1064.29,15,759,0,True,2021

You seek clues and help from jeering ravens, an eyeless scribe, a living furnace, a mismade mermaid, and many more who dwell within the park. All the while, a shadow shrieks from atop a towering roller-coaster, and you know that until you destroy this Dark Thing, the woman will keep jumping, falling, and dying, over and over again.... Strangeland is a classic point-and-click adventure that integrates a compelling narrative with engaging puzzles. For almost a decade, we've been working on a worthy successor to the fan-acclaimed Primordia , and we are proud, at long last, to share our second game. Strangeland is a place like no other. Even in the real world, carnivals occupy a twilight territory between the fantastic and the mundane, the alien and the familiar. In their funhouse mirrors, their freaks, and their frauds, we see hideous and haunting reflections of ourselves, and we witness the wonder and horror of humanity in just a few frayed tents, peeling circus wagons, dingy booths, and run-down rides. Strangeland , of course, is most definitely not the real world. Indeed, unraveling the connections between this nightmare and the real world is the game's central mystery, and finding a way out is its central challenge. As you explore Strangeland , you will need to gather otherworldly tools and win strange allies to overcome a daunting array of obstacles. Forge a blade from iron stolen from the jaws of a ravenous hound and hone it with wrath and grief; charm the eye out of a ten-legged teratoma; and ride a giant cicada to the edge of oblivion.... Amidst such madness, death itself has no grip on you, and you will wield that slippery immortality to gain an edge over your foes. Navigating this domain of monsters and metaphors will require understanding its denizens and its enigmas. Unlike many adventure games that offer a linear experience and single-solution puzzles, Strangeland lets you pick your own way, your own approach, and your own meaning—one player might win a carnival game with sharpshooting, another by electrical engineering; one player might unravel a strange prophet's wordplay while another gathers visual clues scattered throughout the environment. Ultimately, Strangeland 's story will be your story. You are not the audience; you are the player. Approximately five hours of gameplay, replayable thanks to different choices, different puzzle solutions, and different endings Breathtaking pixel art in twice Primordia 's resolution (640x360—party like it's 1999!) Dozens of rooms to explore, with variant versions as the carnival grows ever more twisted An eccentric cast, including a sideshow freak, a telepathic starfish, an animatronic fortune-teller, and a trio of masqueraders Full, professional voice over and hours of original music A rich, thematic story about identity, loss, self-doubt, and redemption Integrated, in-character hint system (optional, of course) Hours of developer commentary and an 'annotation mode' (providing on-screen explanations for the references woven throughout the game) At Wormwood Studios, we make games out of love—love for the games we've spent our lifetimes playing, love for the games we ourselves create, and love for the players who have made all of those games possible. We know that players invest not just their money and time in the games they play, but also their hope and enthusiasm. And we want to make sure that players receive a rich return on that investment by creating games that provide not only a fun, challenging diversion for a few hours, but also lasting memories to keep for years. We think the best way to achieve that with Strangeland is to adhere to the genius of the adventure genre: the marriage of challenging puzzles and thrilling exploration, on the one hand, with an engaging narrative, on the other. At the same time, we've tried to remove the punitive aspects of adventure games (deaths, dead ends, illogical puzzles, pixel hunting, backtracking, etc.). Within this framework, we add uncanny visuals, memorable characters, and thought-provoking themes. The result for Primordia was a game that has received thousands of positive player reviews, and we have refined our approach further with Strangeland . We hope it will not disappoint the players who have given us such great support and encouragement over the years! And we hope that it will find a place in the hearts of new players as well.",536,8034.64,480,950,23,True,2021

Face the unknown… …and fight a vast number of hand-crafted and -animated enemies in over 20 lovingly detailed levels. Confront deadly bosses inspired by real historical figures as seen through the distorted lens of a nightmarish world where black magic and dark science rule supreme. Challenge the Moon King and send him back into the pits! Features Classic 2D Action: No backtracking, no inventory. Only pure, traditional action platforming gameplay. Tactical Combat: Rely on a powerful, single-shot musket that must be reloaded after every round and a swift rapier to conserve ammunition in visceral melee skirmishes. Face the unyielding hordes of the undead, rendered in beautifully animated sprites! Explore around 20 breathtaking stages with different routes. Visit authentic places and meet historical characters of the time. Animated cutscenes - inspired by the silent era of film - bring the darkest chapter of Heidelberg to life. Story The year is 1693: War engulfs Europe as France, led by the illustrious Louis XIV, battles the Grand Alliance. Also called the Sun King for his luxurious tastes and extravagant appearances, he is driven by the belief that the sun – his sun – should shine upon all peoples of the world. His enemies are as numerous as the stars but it is the moon that reigns the night. Poisoned and left for dead, Louis’s bastard son emerges from the smoke and ashes of Germany’s battlefields under the guise of the Moon King. With hatred festering in his heart, he has employed the aid of diabolical and forbidden sciences to build an army the likes of which the world had not seen since the days of Lucifer’s rebellion. Now the dead rise from their mass graves, seeking vengeance upon the king that demanded their deaths while he basked in glory. Can you, the Sun King’s bravest musketeer, stop the approaching eclipse before it swallows the sun? Rules Timing your actions is critical to success in this game, as a correctly timed jump or attack can be the difference between glorious victory and shameful defeat. Furthermore, studying and understanding your enemies will be of utter importance. Only by getting to know your demons can you hope to find their weaknesses – and exploit them. For instance, many foes can hurt not just you but also each other. Goading them into slaughtering their own is often vital to success. Lastly, a word of warning: The Moon King's army is not composed of conventional soldiers. These are the living dead, and simply killing them once is not enough to guarantee their surrender. There is only one antidote against the cancer of undeath: gunpowder and shot. Landing the killing blow with your musket will tear apart the body and make further resurrection impossible. Keep in mind that you can also shoot corpses before they revive. About Development on the game began in January, 2018. The feature we worked the longest on is the musket. There was hardly a precedent from other games for a similar mechanic, so we could not simply take an existing mechanic and put our own spin on it. Instead it was necessary to dive into and really understand the 17th century in order to transform the historical rules of early gunpowder weapons into a viable gameplay mechanic for a 2D action platformer. We spent a lot of time visiting museums and poring over books in order to make the game as authentic as we could. After we had a foundation that is accurate, we set free our creativity and created a typical 'Andrade Game' that is always an interplay between history and morbid phantasy.

It's not all cuddles and snoot boops though: running a shelter can be a lot of work. You have to manage all of the dogs' needs in order to maximize their chances of finding the right forever homes. Each day brings new challenges and rewards. Dogs have specific preferences, can get infectious diseases, and can have negative traits. But you can also hold fundraisers, get random donations, and, if you work hard, help someone find their new best friend. Unfortunately, there's never enough room, and always more dogs. Some dogs are more desirable than others, but maybe if you can afford to wait long enough, just maybe, every dog will have their day. Support real-world charity. 20% of the developer's profit from sales of To The Rescue! goes towards real dog shelters through our charity partner the PetFinder Foundation. Every dog is unique. Each dog is generated with its own traits and preferences to make them distinctive and memorable. Match dogs with adopters' needs. Adopters will often come into the shelter looking for specific things. Match their preferences to increase the chances of adoption. Upgrade and customize your shelter. If you end up with some spare funds, you can upgrade the shelter to have deluxe kennels, get help with cleaning or upkeep, and more! Keep the shelter open. Sometimes it can be tough to afford to take care of all the dogs in the shelter. You'll need to be thrifty and sometimes make tough decisions so that you can keep helping dogs find homes. ...and yes, of course you can pet the dogs! Every dog is unique - Each dog is generated with its own traits, food preferences, personalities, health quirks, names, training values, and more to make them unique and memorable. With 28 different breed variants, there are all kinds of dogs to take care of and show to potential adopters. These adopters will often come into the shelter looking for specific things. Match their preferences to increase the chances of adoption. Fulfill their needs - Dogs need food, water, and shelter. They also need to be kept clean and happy. It's up to you, as the main employee of the shelter, to take care of them. It can get hectic, but it's all worth it to see them find their forever homes. Minigames - For a break from the hectic day-to-day, there are other ways you can ensure that dogs are well taken care of. There are 4 minigames: Tug O’ War, Itchy Scritch, Fetch, and Bathtime Balance the Budget - The shelter runs on donations and adoptions, and there are multiple ways to spend your money. You'll have to manage your budget to make sure that you can pay for food, vaccines, and other unexpected expenses. Each day brings new challenges - In addition to your regular daily upkeep tasks and costs, random events can disrupt the routine. Diseases can break out and spread, new dogs can show up at the wrong time, and tough decisions will have to be made. Grow and Upgrade - Upgrade your shelter to increase the number of dogs you can house, make it more efficient to feed and water them, and make the shelter dogs as comfortable as you can. It's your shelter: guide how it grows! Event-driven story - In To The Rescue!'s main story mode you can progress from housing dogs in your own garage to running a giant, efficient shelter of your own. There will always be events that keep you on your toes, and story threads that develop between them. Fostering and Adopting - The most important part of running a shelter is helping animals find homes. Match dogs' traits with the preferences of visitors to maximize their chances of finding homes. Find fosters who can take care of dogs when you don't have room. In-Game Community Impact - It's not just the shelter activities that you have to manage; you also must establish the shelter as part of the community. Host events, promote, educate, and make sure that you stay in a positive light. From the very beginning of the project, we wanted to teach about the real world problems shelters face. The truth of the matter is that there are way more dogs and cats in need than shelters can handle. It can be hard for “no-kill” shelters to take in every animal that might need help. There are dogs that may be hard to adopt, rehabilitate, or find room for. No one ever wants to have to euthanize, but since we want to raise awareness, we don’t want to pretend that it’s not potentially part of the job. It’s not glorified or presented as an easy way out, but it’s an important part of the experience.

Alternatively you can join official Discord channel in order to find a group of players here. Description Under Lock is a survival horror game that will immerse you into the grim ambience of damnation. The players can take one of the two opposing roles: monster or survivor. The game is designed for 5 players. One of the players takes the role of the monster, whose goal is to mercilessly murder all the survivors. The other 4 players, in an attempt to survive, have to search for keys, which will eventually unlock an exit from the building. Since the keys and other items appear in random locations, each round on the same level will be unique what will keep you entertained for many hours. Moreover, the diversity of gameplay is achieved not only with random placement of items on the map, but also by completely different monsters, each of which has a unique hunting style and a separate set of skills. Play as a survivor As a survivor, your goal is to look for keys, that lead to the desired salvation. But one must remember, that not all keys lead to freedom. Some of the keys give access to other useful items. It is important to work as a team to achieve maximal efficiency against the monster, but do not forget the one main rule. The most important thing is to survive. Play as a monster Your goal is to exterminate all other players, but this cannot be done at the beginning. Scare the survivors first to become gain power which will unlock new abilities and eventually possibility to devour a victims. Currently two different monsters is available: Flatface is unable to move while someone looking at him, but it have set of abilities which allows him to disorient nearby survivors and perform unexpected attacks. Wheeper is unable to see survivors directly, however its set of abilities helps him to detect, track and hunt down survivors which are not careful enough. Shady is invisible until he gains enough strength, but still casts a shadow, and until then he is a harmless observer. VR support For people who are ready to truly challenge their mettle, Under Lock is available in VR. Now, when the boundaries of virtual reality are not clear, the monster is way scarier than you could imagine, it will follow your steps, startling you with every rustle.

In Cyclotronica , players race through a series of experimental reactors and particle accelerators as 'Mr. Big', the ironically tiny rider of an ultra-high tech monowheel cycle, collecting subatomic particles, conducting experiments, dodging and doing battle with antimatter and radioactive isotopes using the patented S.C.I.E.N.C.E. Gun, solving puzzles, and discovering the Periodic Table of the Elements in the process. Cyclotronica 's single player campaign puts you at the epicenter of a novel research venture using the Mr. Big probe to run nuclear experiments from the inside, up close and personal - in places where humans simply cannot go on their own. 6 Campaign Levels: Ionization Accelerator Tunnel By Prescription Only Pop Nihilism Mobile Chernobyl The Rent-A-Tron A Naked Singularity, A Planck Star More Campaign Levels coming soon, with ongoing periodic new releases. This is a Father-and-Son project with just the two devs Randy and Jason, this was our art project for quarantine! All of your support is so appreciated and if you're having fun, we are too. NEW IN VERSION 1.0.2 Cyclotron Track Builder We've added a brand new Track Builder with well over 300+ Track Section Prefabs with which you can now construct YOUR VERY OWN PARTICLE ACCELERATOR -- and of course the ability to Save and Load your own Tracks. Right now everything's in Single Player BUT this will also be a jump-off point for Players to host their own Cyclotron Races and Crucible Battles later. There's a Materials Selector and a selection of different series of Accelerator Tunnel Prefab parts... Coils, Curves, and Straightaways, Gates and Ramps, Hazards, Particle Emitters, etc. I'm just cracking into designs for the tracks myself and will be releasing lots more parts and deeper Series Prefabs. Right now most Prefabs go up to about Mark V or VI. I could easily see them going up to XIII. The speeds you can attain are really something. Remember: There is no cap on the speed boost you can obtain from Electrons in Cyclotronica, and we pledge that there never will be. Stay negatively charged, Friends! Isotope Chamber Minigame The Isotope Chamber Minigame is in full service, less the online Leaderboard Stats [which we plan on doing for sure, and we'll sync all top scores when that happens]. The Isotope Chamber is a simple Clicker Minigame where you fire subatomic particles and antiparticles at Atoms you have created to try to discover as many different Isotopes as you can. We already had it out with version 1.0.1, but our Atom system wasn't fully fleshed out and we only had a measly 1,200 out of the now nearly 3,200 Isotopes known to Science. (I hit the books and made sure we had every Isotope discovered). Now that the Isotope Data Set is COMPLETE, you can start from a simple Hydrogen Atom and bombard it with Neutrons until it becomes Helium, then Lithium and so on up to the very heaviest elements, or go from the heaviest elements and get chain fission reactions and mayhem in the chamber that would absolutely kill you dead in Campaign Mode. Chip away at Atoms a bit at a time and watch them fall to pieces or detonate with the Antiproton and Antineutrons. All of the Isotopes have real half-lives calculated in real time, so theoretically you could leave the game running for millions of years and never get some Isotopes to decay unless you shoot them. Isotope Chamber now keeps track of your stats, showing: How many unique Isotopes you've Discovered, The number of Atoms you manually Created, The number of Particles/Antiparticles you Emitted in the Chamber, and Elapsed Time. Top Ten Scores as you continue playing. It weights scores by Discovered Isotopes over Time, with a minor portion being from Atom and Particle Spawns. We have more ideas on score weighting and future plans for how the Isotope Chamber works. Meanwhile... Improvements: Upgrades: Atom Catalog has been overhauled to work more with our vision going forward where it will be a sort of Atomic Spellbook. Atoms to be awarded to the Player through mission interactions stack up in Queue and are issued when a Player beats a level if so, and then Players can choose to exchange their spare Particle Inventory for additional new Atoms. General UI Upgrades everywhere as we march through and refactor bits of code and optimize it going forward. Lots of basic things like text highlights and colors for selected or unselected interface objects, tightening up copy editing throughout the UI, implementing beta tester feedback. S.C.I.E.N.C.E. Gun Interface updated with better messaging and priority functions as you gather enough particles to use the gun, or after you've exhausted your ammo. Players get HUD messages and button instructions for switching Weapons when they first get enough Particle ammo as well. Messages happen once for each, etc. Weapon switching priority likely optimized - I know people have opinions about that stuff. I made it so that if you had a weapon selected and run out of Particles, when you get enough Particles again, you'll automatically switch back to your last used Weapon. Player Weapons updated with tracers. Weapon burst code updated for Neutron Salvo and Gamma Ray Burst. Neutrons now add +1 to maximum cycle damage [although they don't repair damage], in addition to their mass and use as 'ammo'. Antimatter upgraded with its own Chemical Symbol notation similar to Atoms, showing you a rough idea of its 'Hit Points' i.e. Antiparticle Score you're trying to zero out with the S.C.I.E.N.C.E. Gun in order to destroy them. The notation also shows ionization charge as well so you know how many Positrons it may spawn when destroyed. Downstream Interactions like collisions with Alpha Particles now result in the creation of a deionized Helium-4 Atom [after they damage your GyroCycle and remove some of your Electrons, that is], which floats away innocently, mocking you. Things like that are necessary as I head toward implementing Fusion. Spare change has to be able to turn into Atoms and vice versa. Campaign Levels 1-6 have all received various upgrades: Level 1 - Upgraded hazards, adjusted ramp mix of particle types, improved the Inset messages. Awards Hydrogen to Player on Completion. Level 2 - Implemented full Isotope system on the Fluorine Atoms spawning. Lithium Bullet visual adjustments. Awards Fluorine-19 on completion. Careful with the Neutrons... Level 3 - Boss fight containment improvements. Antimatter Boss firing rate nerfed (still hurls dangerous three round Antiparticle bursts from both sides, often). Players are locked in the boss room after Entry. Separate Chamber from which the Antimatter Boss enters. Boss floats in before beginning attack. Level 4 - Isotope System fully implemented on all Atoms in Mobile Chernobyl. Awards Uranium-238 on Completion. Fission Blast damage radius adjusted. (Still balancing...) Level 5 - Z Align on all Sector Placards with Game Camera. X-Ray Flash stats updated. Level 6 - Gamma Ray Burst adjustments. Bug Fixes: Bulkhead Doors not opening in Level 3.

We see games as potential carriers of great art like any other creative medium. We have tried to match our words with actions by shunning traditional “game” traps like genres, graphic styles, or mechanics, while seeking out games that make us lean in. That make us feel something. We see games as vehicles for a greater message, than purely entertainment. SO WHAT? Art is never so important as during difficult times. Art allows us to escape, to seek meaning, and to give a universal voice to our inner thoughts. On top of interpreting our collective past and present, art carries our hopes, dreams, fears, and wishes for a better future. Due to this transcendent quality games have never been more important than during this hellscape of a year. We have seen this in the messages people have sent us and in the titles submitted to us. It's time for us at Raw Fury to take the next step, to stand behind our convictions. We've opened two game-focused art galleries — One in Stockholm, Sweden and the other in Zagreb, Croatia. As the bases of operations, these two cities will be the hub in which we begin to prove “games as art” to the world. In addition, we're launching this virtual gallery to give folks from across the globe a chance to see what can happen when you bring a bunch of artists together in creating works inspired by video games.

6108,True Mining Simulator,2021-01-07,4.99,0,Boolba Entertainment,Boolba Entertainment,"Indie,Simulation,Early Access","True Mining Simulator will teach you to mine. We’re not talking copper, iron or coal. We’re talking money. Real money, made straight out of nowh… out of electricity. You will like it. What do you even mean? Cryptocurrency . Cryptocurrency is the kind of currency that exists only in the digital realm, arousing controversies around it and is constantly on a drastic rise (or fall). You’ve heard all about it. Everybody’s heard about it, yet few know what’s what. Basically that’s the reason we are making this game. True Mining Simulator is a full fletched simulator of a miner. A miner is a person who mines cryptocurrency . Miners purchase video cards, assemble stands and use those to earn valuable coins, which they then sell. Or keep them, hoping to get a better exchange rate. This is what you are going to be doing. Buy hardware, farm coins, sell coins, buy more hardware. And that’s it? Doesn’t look too … Ain’t it too simple? Oh yeah? Think about this for a moment: hardware must at least pay off; it must not become outdated while being delivered; 8 graphics cards in one stand must not overheat; these stands must be assembled properly; you must choose you farming station correctly, and there are plenty to choose from; if you spend all your money on hardware, what are you going to eat? Basically, this is the reason we are making this game. Mining is like chess: simple on the outside, complicated on the inside. And we suggest you figure out all mining intricacies on your own, without having to buy 10 video cards, $500 each. Okay, what else do you have in the simulator? Everything you need for a full immersion: farms must be assembled with your own hands; hunger (must eat); you have a unique chance to forget your wallet password and lose everything. And our plans for upcoming updates included: day\night cycles, respective division of events; fatigue (must rest); ability to get employed (trust us, you will need it); you can move to a more spacious place, if you wish to do so … and if you can afford it; you can be burglarized, your house can burn down (nice, right?); Sounds interesting! When will the game be out? As soon as possible. The game is in its active development stage. You can facilitate the process by supporting us.

(Eg: most action platformers.) And narrative driven games have a lot of dialogue which is too advanced for learners. We've used simple language designed for beginners and accompanied by helpful imagery. 'Will you be releasing this game in other languages as well?' It's currently also available in Spanish under the title 'Pedro's Adventures in Spanish'.

Learn to use the immune system to defeat minor germs on a regular basis, and before long you will be defending against viruses, diseases, and even unknown entities. Choose the enemies that most require your attention and learn what threats the immune system can handle on its own. This is the path to VICTORY! But beware, the immune system is a fragile ecosystem, the body responds to most threats by raising and lowering it's temperature. Allow it to be overwhelmed and your immune system will collapse, rendering you unable to defeat the incoming foreign creatures. If your body temperature gets too high, you will succumb to the FEVER and all will be lost. If your body temperature gets too low, hypothermia will set in and the body will be too weak to mount a defense against the incoming hordes. GAMEPLAY From your vantage point, inside the blood vessels, various germs, viruses, diseases and other ailments will try to overcome the body. Quickly sterilize them as they race towards you. Unlike many games, FEVER boasts a dynamic health system; your temperature gauge (thermometer) will raise or lower in response to the different microbial assaults and either extreme temperature (Hot or Cold) will collapse your immune system and spell destruction for the body. But you are NOT isolated! The immune/circulatory systems of the body have your back! Collect enough 'Cellular Residue' from your enemies and you can create White Blood Cells (WBCs) to help you attack the invading forces. Or you can even take direct control of the circulatory system to flush out the foreign entities; your Red Blood Cells (RBCs) will keep the blood flowing and help regulate your body temperature back to an optimum level of YOUR CHOOSING! RBCs can even sweep away certain contaminates giving you more time to take permanent action. NOT ENOUGH? Well how about spending your Cellular Residue to directly upgrade your Blood Cells? Increase the spawn frequency or amount of either Blood Cells and or upgrade each type's unique abilities! RBCs not regulating temperature well enough? Then boost their performance and each one can alter the body temperature by a much greater amount. As for your WBCs, build up these bad boys and they'll pack a bigger punch requiring far fewer numbers to take out a given enemy. OBJECTIVE SURVIVE! REPEL THE INVADERS! Take on multiple bosses as you rack up that Cellular Residue, your score also increases in a true old-school arcade-style which will leave you setting and breaking High-scores like never before. But body health is an ongoing struggle, so even after you defeat the big baddies of the body there will still be plenty of cleanup to do in the 'endless mode'.

We've all wanted to confront the limits of our sanity via dropping into a savage arena where grotesque displays of cannibalism and regurgitation are not only encouraged, but vital to claiming victory. We've all daydreamed of clambering over towering corpse piles of unworthy foes, fuzzy bunnies, and bougie bankers. It is our unspoken but commonly shared aspiration to gaze into the recently deceased open eyes of our own previous incarnations, before consuming said corporeal familiars to fuel nefarious future acts. And lo, the efforts of humankind have been squandered into misguided deeds such as “moon landings” and “disease eradication”, and thus no such sublime arena yet exists. Attempting to fill this void, Epic Banana Games offers humanity a crude facsimile, a digital simulacrum mimicking the raw emotional intensity that such a glorious arena will elicit (once it inevitably exists). Accumulate the most wealth. Survive the longest – or become a petulant ghost to torment your rivals. Utilize arcane ingestion techniques to imbue your vomit with flame and ice, spreading chaos and destruction in your wake. But beware: as brutal as your competitors strive to be, you may find the arena itself to offer the most potent dangers. So venture forth and decimate, decapitate, and masticate your way to victory in such manner that, upon witnessing, the ancient gladiators of yore could only remark “Forsooth! Mine best bloody efforts are sullied as puerile amateurism in witness of these decadent, depraved deeds!”. The arena awaits!

There are millions of different combinations that can be played just with Dominion alone. Each game is different but only lasts twenty to thirty minutes. It's great for one player but just as fun with two or more players. GOAL This is a game of building a deck of cards. The deck contains your resources, victory points, and the things you can do. It starts out a small sad collection of Estates and Coppers, but you hope that by the end of the game it will be brimming with Gold, Provinces, and the inhabitants and structures of your kingdom. GAME IDEA You are a monarch, like your parents before you, a ruler of a small pleasant kingdom of rivers and evergreens. Unlike your parents, however, you have hopes… dreams! You want a bigger kingdom, more pleasant, with more rivers, and a wider variety of trees. You want a Dominion! In all directions lie fiefs, freeholds, and feodums. All are small bits of land, controlled by petty lords and verging on anarchy. You will bring civilization to these people, uniting them under your banner. But wait! It must be something in the air; several other monarchs have had the exact same idea. You must race to get as much of the unclaimed land as possible, fending them off along the way. To do this you will hire minions, construct buildings, spruce up your castle, and fill the coffers of your treasury.

You are presented with a field of nodes, each having a number. Nodes may be connected to each other along gridlines with either single or double bridges. A puzzle is complete when all nodes are connected, and the number of bridges connected to each node is equal to the number indicated on that node. HexiHashi is a fresh and original take on this classic puzzle. Whereas classic Hashi is played on a rectangular grid, HexiHashi is played on a triangular grid. A game of classic Hashi can be solved nearly completely using deductive reasoning, with normally only one or two moves per game requiring an intuitive guess. In HexiHashi, because each node has six possible connections instead of four, pure deduction will normally solve less than 10% of a puzzle (even small ones). As a result, gameplay focuses more on inuitive heuristics, testing hypotheses, backtracking, and tweaking of solutions. One puzzle in HexiHashi may have more than one acceptable solution, but our puzzle generation algorithm guarantees that every puzzle is solvable. Features: - Beautiful piano score by the inimitable Steve McRae - Dynamic sound effects which harmonize with the background music - Puzzle Generation Algorithm providing endless replayability - Time Attack, Move Master, and Endless modes - Cool-looking Hint system - Levelling System HexiHashi will scratch the puzzle-itch of any avid puzzler.

The Seven Stones Reef in the Celtic Sea is thought to be the remnants of this long-forgotten place. Mythology tells of how the Edenic island was buried under the sea by the gods because the inhabitants led lives of pure hedonism. On stormy days, fishermen still claim to catch nefarious objects from the city in their nets. You play as an explorer who has navigated the perilous journey to the island after hearing the stories of its wondrous beauty. Alone, you row to shore and discover its secrets. Lyonesse is a point-and-click game. You experience the mythical land by navigating through hundreds of hand-drawn panels. Moving between each unique panel will allow you to explore the island and experience its erotic encounters. A brief visit will typically last the player 45 minutes, but discovering all the secrets Lyonesse and its nymphs have to offer will captivate the player for much longer. The game’s story is organised into four seasons of festivities. Each season, the voyeur is visited by a unique nymph. Between each act, the player sleeps under a great orange tree. On your journey, you are accompanied by two kittens named Crucible and Caliban. As the seasons proceed, the orange trees slowly flourish and begin to bear fruit.

And you're ready to be immersed in a Spanish speaking world of adventure? Then take control of Pedro as he travels across the kingdom, solving puzzles, making friends and defeating monsters. His journey to save the princess mirrors your journey into learning Spanish! Pedro's Adventures in Spanish is designed to be entirely in Spanish with no in-game translations and will be useful regardless of your native language. All interface, dialogue and narration is in simple Spanish accompanied by carefully designed images and animations to help you understand the game play and objectives. This is not a classroom, there are no quizzes or word matching exercises. The purpose of this game is to provide a fun but challenging environment for you to practice and learn through immersion. Just how we learn our native languages! FEATURES Dozens of unique characters fully voice acted by native Spanish speakers Auto-saved progress and no death mechanic encourages experimentation without risk Over 4000 lines of in-game Spanish dialogue Approximately 10-20 hours of game play (depending on experience level) FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS 'Is this game for beginners?' No... *unless* you're very serious about learning Spanish through immersion, enjoy a challenge, and are willing to learn as you go. This game is particularly useful for people who have a very basic level of Spanish and want to put what they're learning into practice while improving their vocabulary. You'll get the best results if you spend a few weeks or months learning the basics before starting this game. 'How is this different to just playing any regular game in Spanish?' Games with language simple enough for beginners typically don't require much language comprehension to play. (Eg: most action platformers.) And narrative driven games have a lot of dialogue which is too advanced for learners. It's also rare to find those games with full audio dialogue transcribed into other languages. Pedro's Adventures uses simple language designed for beginners and accompanied by helpful imagery. That said, we would recommend that you try playing some of your favorite RPGs in Spanish. If you are able to understand all your objectives then congratulations! Your Spanish is already quite excellent. 'Everything is in Spanish without translation? Won't I feel overwhelmed?' Sometimes, yes! But don't be discouraged, you can absolutely complete this game even if you don't understand every word that's being said. If you can persevere you'll find that you're still able to understand your objectives and how to achieve them. New language learners often find themselves quite overwhelmed when first attempting to interact in the language they’re studying. This is a natural part of the process. Just watch for keywords and context, and don't be afraid to experiment! 'Will this be useful if I want to learn Spanish from Spain (Castilian)?' In short, yes. Especially if you are a beginner. The script and voice performances were done by Latin American Spanish speakers but most of the common verbs and nouns are the same in both variations of the language. Even though some of the words in the game might be less commonly used in Spain, Spaniards and Latinos are typically able to understand each other perfectly. 'Will you be releasing this game in other languages as well?' If there is sufficient support for Pedro's Adventures then we intend to release it for other languages starting with the romance languages (French, Italian, Portuguese etc) and then eventually in Asian languages (Japanese, Mandarin Chinese, Korean etc). 'Will it be available on other platforms? (macOS, Android, consoles etc)' Initially it will only be available for Windows PC, but if there is sufficient demand for it then down the track we'd love to port the game to macOS, Linux, consoles and mobile devices. A WORD FROM THE CREATORS Pedro's Adventures in Spanish is one of many resources you should use when learning a language and is particularly useful for learning common nouns, verbs and pronunciation. We recommend playing it in conjunction with resources that focus on teaching the nuances of grammar and verb conjugation. ROCKET BOY GAMES is an independent games studio with the objective of providing fun alternatives to your language learning experience. This is our first commercial release and with enough support we hope to create a variety of language learning games for Spanish along with other languages. We hope you will be part of that journey.

The game map is composed of small squares, through which we can explore unknown places. You may also encounter different monsters and random events. The round combat system adopted in the game takes breaking shield as the core. The monster has a layer of armor. The number of armor layers of the enemy can be broken by attack or magic. When the enemy's armor layer becomes 0, it is in the shield breaking state. In the shield breaking state, you will hit more damage. Diverse monsters There are abundant monsters and seven different styles of boss wars on the map. Each boss has a unique fighting mechanism and playing method. Of course, you can also pass level rolling or props To win the battle. In a powerful boss battle, the shield breaking mechanism is an important strategic means. You need to observe the enemy's shot and singing time, and reasonably allocate physical strength and magic value. Physical strength: used for power accumulation attack or magic. The attack command after power accumulation will hit multiple segments of damage. The magic command after power accumulation will hit higher damage. Magic value: when dealing with the boss, if the enemy is magic armor, you need to beat magic damage rhythmically to break the shield, but you should master yourself When your magic value is empty, you can fill your magic value back and forth through defense. Defense mechanism: when facing the enemy's powerful moves, you can defend. Defense will provide you with 50% damage reduction by default. Anger skill: attack or magic damage will accumulate anger value. When the anger value is full, you can use anger skill, which will be a full screen second kill skill.

A young soldier of the Free French Forces, Roland, and his sworn friend Olivier participate in the invasion of Normandy to free their motherland. But as they descend to raid the enemy position at the break of dawn, their aircraft is exposed to enemy fire, forcing them to land. Isolated from their unit, the two wander through a forest blanketed by night, where they unexpectedly encounter a group of cavaliers. These ghastly, medieval knights are led by a Edwalda, a female knight in a flowing black dress. Roland swiftly dives to cover Olivier and is fatally injured, losing consciousness── Upon returning to his senses, he finds himself near a calm forest spring, a single lovely girl having nursed him back to health. Roland's life threatening injury was healed, as if it was never there to begin with, causing him to wonder if the knights' attack was merely a dream… but he is mistaken.

And the girl who saved him was the maiden trapped at the center of this history of war- the “captive of time”, the fated girl - Jeanne. The moment this young man and the maiden meet, the clock tower breaks its long lasting silence, and once again begins to mark the passage of time.

Set in a universe of vast scale and detail, the fully-destructible environment and hybrid voxel/vertex-based game mechanics enable simulations in Starbase at immense depth, giving players the ultimate freedom to exploit their innovativeness and creativity. From constructing spaceships that can endure the hazards of space, such as collision and corrosive damages, to creating massive automated factories and designing electricity and data networks, the players are free to do it their own way. A single persistent Universe - Play and interact online with thousands of players and start shaping the world with your fellow robots. Build, fight, chat and group up with other players to discover and settle the vast galaxy that is waiting for its first conquerors to make their mark. Mine asteroids by yourself, trade and haul cargo with your friends, or build a station with a huge company. Success in Starbase is not measured in hours played or an endless grind, but in the ingenuity of each player and their ability to work together. The environment in Starbase is fully destructible, made possible by a mixture of voxel and fracture damage - Everything can be destroyed or disassembled with the right kind of tools and weaponry. The in-depth physics simulation enabled by hybrid voxel/vertex-based game mechanics make fights, exploration and flying spaceships a creative paradise The simulation of structural and elemental durability in the game adds its own twist and challenge to the efforts to conquer space; poorly designed superstructures combined with overpowered steering thrusters can snap the spaceships in half if cutting corners too much in a space race. Note: Station destruction will be added in the September Siege Mechanics Update Design and build your spaceship, stations and devices down to the tiniest detail, and live the spaceship designer dream by selling your blueprints. The smallest building unit in Starbase is a single bolt, allowing you to build, repair and modify spaceships, stations, and devices as you wish. Even the smallest ships have thousands of parts, each with their own detailed damage model, making building and designing a truly creative process. Learning to use the in-game programming chips will take building and designing to a new level; innovation, automation of ships and creating clever ship layouts will make all the difference! Engage in seamless FPS and spaceship combat with thousands of players simultaneously. Fly solo or crew up with others to divide roles and responsibilities. Creative thinking, crazy ideas and daring maneuvers can turn the tide of battles! Explore the infinitely expanding universe, and discover stations, asteroid fields, spaceship wrecks, social hubs and fellow travelers. Arrange an exploration mission with friends and find out what's hidden in the depths of space and the faraway moons Beware of pirates and unknown dangers when venturing into the uncharted territories! Mine raw minerals from asteroids and salvage different parts from broken ships, trade your salvaged goods at trading stations, or steal from others if that floats your (space)boat. Buy, sell and trade ship parts, materials, weapons, tools, ammo, designs, and invent new ways of earning credits in a player driven economy. Form friendships and alliances, group up with others and establish factions to build massive stations and tackle the most difficult hurdles space has to offer. Starting station safe zones safeguard the new player experience Dynamic safe zones configurable on player-owned stations Developer-lead faction Empire provides protection and security About Starbase Starbase is developed with Frozenbyte’s internal game engine that is custom-built for conquering space, enabling the use of extremely challenging combination of voxel and vertex technologies in the game. The modern engine has been built specifically with Starbase in mind and the engine’s architecture is designed to handle all the quirks of simulation, damage, building, player amounts and the ever-growing universe to match the challenges the ambitious vision of the game can pose. Similarly, all features of the game have been developed with the infinite scale and the creative freedom of the players in mind. Starbase has been in secret development for five years without restraints and the development will continue until the game’s bold vision is achieved. In the ever-expanding space the scale can range from the unit of one bolt to massive space station structures, with exploration missions varying from journeys to nearby asteroid fields, to salvaging ship debris, and eventually to other galaxies. In Starbase players are given the freedom to build the kind of universe they want to, and a small group of players can eventually form large factions that challenge the powers that be. Being inventive will also help, as cleverness often triumphs over brute force in Starbase, and the only limitation is the creativity of the players. Early Access Starbase Early Access will introduce the players, the pioneers, to a new galaxy that they can begin to explore from a bunch of huge stations located at the orbit of a single planet. As the players eventually settle the entire orbit, they can start finding ways to travel to the planet’s moons and someday all the way to other planets and distant star systems. The still unoccupied universe of Starbase offers players the chance to take part in the building of the galaxy and in discovering what will be the first steps in the twilight of space travel. Early Access allows the players to design, build &amp; modify spaceships, explore the universe, form social connections, and earn money by mining, gathering, crafting and selling resources. The players can start building their home stations and begin the expansion of the Starbase universe together with the developers.

Mine minerals, secure energy and water, farm and store food in order to construct residences to house and feed immigrants and more on your journey to colonize Mars. Humanities and Tech Tree Low air pressure, strong ambient radiation, sandstorms and numerous natural phenomena, coupled with limited resources, are great obstacles to the Martian base's expansion. Hence, you must conduct research to create better technology and increase Mars' productivity. This will strengthen the Martian base in turn. You may make use of the diverse options of the tech tree to perform research into technology that meets the needs of their colony. With the continuous influx of residents, their daily lives will be marked with their own sorrows and joys, as well as all kinds of needs. Leisure facilities and a welfare policy must be established along with proper living conditions that take care of all aspects of their lives. With a happy population, success is but a step away from the plans to reshape Mars. Rich variety of random events Where people roam, so will there be events and incidents that punctuate their lives. You will encounter all kinds of random events: what is the intent of the secretive stowaways to Mars and where they come from. What plans do the many factions back on Terra have for the fledgling Martian base? What is behind the mysterious faction that makes itself known on Mars out of the blue? What are the origins of the wreck stamped with 'xSpac' and a dog's head emblem? These mysteries are all waiting to be discovered and unraveled. Real-time Strategy Accidents happen and conflict are par for the course. What better way to secure the Martian base and resist the invasion than to build an armed force that defends Mars? This is the moment for all the cruiser tanks, ripper missile tanks, raptor fighters to shine! Issue commands to your armed unit in real time and duke it out with your enemies! Educating with entertainment All in-game locations are real Martian geological features and approximately sited in the same locations (E.g. Valles Marineris, Acidalia Planitia and the Tempe Fossae etc.). Even if your best attempts at making a success of the Martian base go wrong, you would be learning about the lay of the land of Mars.

You will meet representatives of many different powers and factions. Whether Mars shall forge strong alliances, conduct fair trade or light the beacons of war is all in your hands.

Try to get them all in one shot for a top rank, or progress steadily by focusing on one objective per run. Wingmen - Bring a wingman into action to fight along your side. While managing two ships at once makes you a bigger target, the wingmen compensate by offering greater firepower, and extra special abilities. The most effective way to progress in the game is to achieve a harmonious relationship with your wingmen. 3 unique wingmen characters can be unlocked by playing missions. Special Abilities - In addition to an array of standard projectiles, the Titan and wingmen have special abilities. These include offensive attacks, shields, and the ability to slow time. In order to use specials you must keep a stock of Plasma, which is collected from busting up crystals and absorbing it from Space Kraken. Upgrades - Collect Golden Parts in battle, and use them to purchase hundreds of incremental upgrades in order to improve 8 different ship components. Not only do you grow stronger in combat, you also get the satisfaction of detailed visual changes to your Titan in the hangar. Proudly watch your stock gray bird light up like a Christmas tree, as your robot mechanic tinkers away. Difficulty Tiers - There are four difficulty tiers for every world, which each offer a fresh set of medals to earn, and greater GP rewards. Not only does the difficulty increase by statistical parameters, new and improved units appear in higher difficulties, keeping you on your heels and providing a sense of newness. Star Carts - Special upgrades can be unlocked by somewhat rare item drops. If you find a Star Cart you must survive to the end of the mission to acquire its reward. Star Carts provide a variety of perks including enhanced wingman weapons, upgrade discounts, character skins, and many more! Achievements - Go above and beyond to achieve more than just bragging rights. 36 achievements are fully integrated into the experience, and offer in-game GP rewards.

In future settings we are implementing PvP as 1 on 1 and up to 4 players in a battle royale style where players compete for time capsules, one-time-use-weapons and re-usable traps. The story-mode will hopefully get a co-op mode in the middle of 2022 and after that, we will see what you, our player-base asks for. Our ears are here for you so please send us ideas for future releases, we want Cubes of Death to be fun, fastpaced and re-playable.",0,0.0,0,804,28,True,2021

Weeks have passed since the zombie virus took hold of humanity, and most of the population has already been infected. As one of the few survivors, you are still safely holed up in your house. When the power and water cut out, you must finally venture out to join up with the other survivors at the Terminus. Battle hunger, frigid temperatures, and zombies to make it to the safe zone and perhaps have a chance of survival! KEY FEATURES Randomly Generated Map - At the beginning of every run, an entire city is randomly generated, consisting of about 150 different places. The supplies you scavenge for and their locations are also randomly generated. This ensures no two games are ever the same, and your journey to the Terminus is just as challenging every time. Turn-Based Play - Every action you take deducts from your action points (AP). Strategic management of your AP while you move, search, and attack will be critically important to your survival. AP is restored at the beginning of each turn, but think carefully before you end your turn and give the zombies a chance to attack! Status Management - Keep an eye on your condition to stay in peak fighting shape. You’ll need to eat, sleep, and stay warm to perform optimally, and keep up your morale to have the courage to keep going. All of these things deteriorate after every turn, and finding ways to manage them is one of the game’s biggest challenges. Various Survivors - You won’t be given some generic survivor character. Each game begins with a character creator where you can name your character as well as select their occupation and trait. Make careful selections and allocate extra points to create the ultimate survivor. Various Places and Items - You’ll visit all kinds of locations, including police stations, grocery stores, and abandoned houses. These locations can contain hundreds of different items that will be important for your survival, like food, clothing, medicine, weapons, tools, and more. Fight Zombies - As you get closer to the Terminus, more and more zombies will stand in your way to prevent you from reaching your goal. At your disposal are a variety of weapons, each with its own advantages and disadvantages depending on the parts you choose to attack. Day/Night and Weather - With each turn, one hour passes. You’ll need to manage your time efficiently because once the sun goes down and darkness sets in, danger lurks around every corner unseen. You’ll also need to contend with rain, snow, and temperature changes, all of which affect your character’s condition. NPCs - On your journey, you will sometimes come across other survivors in the form of NPCs. These characters might be willing to trade with you or accompany you to the Terminus but it’s up to the player to either cooperate with these NPCs or threaten them and steal their supplies. Permadeath - If you are bitten by a zombie or succumb to the elements, that’s it for that character. Don’t let this discourage you, because every death is a lesson. Use what you learn to get closer to the Terminus every time. Different Modes - Aside from the Default Mode, there are also additional game modes (Out of Stock, Crowd, Frozen Zombies) that alter gameplay parameters and add challenges.

It transforms simple input images consisting of smart pixels into many distinct output images with varying properties, such as gradient, noise and color which can then be exported and used in your projects. Demo version There's a demo version of Spritify that you can get for free to evaluate it. In the demo some of the import and export functions are disabled. Also many of the sizes and factors are greatly limited (Palette, Canvas, Sprite counts, Scaling factors, ...). All other features are available. Guide Quick overview Hotkeys Note that several functions can also be performed via hotkeys. Hover your cursor over functions to see if there's a hotkey mapped to it. Canvas On the canvas you can draw your input image which is then used to generate your sprites. The canvas displays both the color and behavior of individual pixels. The color is displayed as a pixel's color, the behavior as a character (More under Brushes ). You can left click to draw single pixels, drag while holding the left mouse button to draw a path or right click to flood fill. By default the canvas is filled with the Background color and N one behavior When hovering with your cursor, the currently active brush will be displayed The canvas after drawing several pixels The Preview Below the canvas there's a preview of the sprite. It will display the same result you'd receive by performing an export. Please note that the preview's pixels are scaled to always use all available space, your exported result will likely have smaller pixels. Sidebar The sidebar contains all of Spritify's settings and controls. The sidebar is split in groups which can be expanded and collapsed by clicking a group's header. Import | Export Here you can save and load projects and export your sprites. Load Import a previously saved Spritify project You can also import projects by opening the files with Spritify or using drag&amp;drop Save Save your current project Result.zip Export your sprite as .zip archive containing the individual .bmp images Result.bmp Export your sprite as a single .bmp image (What you see in the preview) Brushes Your current brush and pixels on the canvas consist of a color and behavior . The different brushes are described below. Color brushes The color brushes set the color a pixel will have. The currently active brush is highlighted with [&gt; You'll notice that each name here has its distinct color. These colors are also placed on the canvas when drawing with that brush. Background Drawing pixels with the background color (similar to erasing pixels) You can set the background color in the Colors controls Fixed Drawing pixels with the fixed color Pixels using this color will always have the same color. You can define which color to use in Colors Dynamic Drawing pixels with the dynamic color Pixels using this color will vary in color. They might each end up with a different color, noise and shading in your final sprite. Many settings affect how these pixels behave, see more under Flags , Shading , Noise and Palette Dynamic | Background Pixels will randomly either become a Dynamic or Background pixel with a 50/50 chance Fixed | Background Pixels will randomly either become a Fixed or Background pixel with a 50/50 chance Fixed | Dynamic Pixels will randomly either become a Fixed or Dynamic pixel with a 50/50 chance Fixed | Dynamic | Background Pixels will randomly either become a Fixed , Dynamic or Background pixel with a 33/33/33 chance Behavior brushes The behavior brushes define the behavior of a pixel during the generation process. The currently active brush is highlighted with [&gt; You'll notice that the first character of each brush is highlighted. That's the character that is being placed onto the canvas if you use this brush. None This is basically the 'background' or 'off' of the behaviors. Pixels of this type are considered to not exist at all during the simulation Static This is basically the 'on' of the behaviors. Pixels of this type are always active and considered to be present during the simulation If Pixels of this type are considered to be Static if they have a neighbor, otherwise they are considered to the None . With these pixels you can define areas that all turn on or off together Walker These pixels will leave a trail on the canvas by following a random path. They'll stop randomly or if they hit something. They behave similar to the Snake game Filler Pixels of this type will fill their surrounding area to a random degree. They are similar to the Walker pixels but instead of creating a trail, they create more radial shapes like drops of ink Jiggler Jigglers will move randomly to a neighbor position or remain where they are Any Chooses any of the other behaviors randomly In this example you can see two groups of If pixels and a group of Filler pixels. In the result you'll notice that the If groups are either present entirely or not at all. Whenever one of the Filler pixels reached one of the groups, the entire group got activated. (One of the If pixels activates due to having a neighbor, which then can activate another If pixel until the entire group is active) Controls Here you can find various functions to edit the canvas. Arrow left Undo the last canvas action (drawing, resizing) Arrow right Redo the last canvas action (drawing, resizing) ++ Zoom in, displaying the canvas with larger pixels -- Zoom out, displaying the canvas with smaller pixels + Increase the size of the canvas by adding a row or column depending on the location of the button - Decrease the size of the canvas by removing a row or column depending on the location of the button 7x6 The current size is displayed at the center ClearI Clear the canvas resetting all invisible pixels (outside of current drawing area) ClearA Clear the canvas resetting all pixels Flags In this group you can find multiple flags to control the sprite generation. Mirror right Mirror all pixels drawn onto the canvas to the right Mirror down Mirror all pixels drawn onto the canvas downwards Edge If the right or bottom edge should also be mirrored Outline Outline the final result with Fixed pixels Remove lonely Remove pixels without any neighbours Mirroring Below some examples explaining the mirroring flags: All mirroring is disabled and there's 4 pixels drawn to the bottom right of the canvas Mirroring to the right is enabled, the edge is not mirrored. In addition to the 4 pixels we now see two of them being mirrored Now both mirroring to the right and edge mirroring is enabled. There's now 8 pixels visible since all 4 input pixels were mirrored Additionally downwards mirroring is now enabled (no edge) Outline When this is active the Fixed color is used to outline the generated images. This usually only makes sense when also setting the Scaling to &gt; 1, since otherwise most pixels will be overwritten. Here the Outline setting is disabled Here the Outline setting is enabled Remove lonely Removal of lonely pixels disabled, there's pixels without any neighbours in the output Removal of lonely pixels enabled, there's no pixels without any neighbours in the output Sprite counts Here you can set the number of images your sprite will have. Count in x Number of images per row Count in y Number of image rows Shading In this group you can configure the shading. Enable shading Here you can toggle the shading Brightness Sets the brightness of the shading Specific direction Enable this if you want to set a specific shading direction for all your sprite images.

Be careful when combining this with high sprite counts since the sprite generation can then use a lot of memory and time. Also avoid setting high values for both scaling factors, since their multiplication affects the performance (both set to 10 -&gt; ~100x worse) Factor before This factor is applied before the simulation having an impact on it (more pixels with different values) This has a huge impact on the performance Factor after This factor is applied at the end, only affecting the size of the output (pixels duplicated with their values) This has less impact on the performance, but still must be used with caution A scaling (before) factor of one. Every input pixel creates an output pixel A scaling (before) factor of two. Every input pixel creates 2x2 (4) output pixels Scaled with a factor (before) of 16.

The result is a unique blend of the strategy and puzzle genres in which you can finish a run quickly, but still have a deep experience full of tough decisions. MAKE TRADE, NOT WAR Colonize planets, carefully pick industries and hook everything up so that your planets support each other. Line everything up just right and watch your colonies evolve and grow, giving you even more options for profitable trade. Make long-term plans and bask in your own glory when that one last connection makes six planets upgrade at the same time and gives you the income you desperately need. There is no military aspect to pull your focus away from the economy. The game is more relaxed than your typical grand strategy. It's all about exploring space and its endless opportunities, shaping it to your whim and developing it to its full potential. No need for war with so much empty universe to claim. FASTER THAN LIGHT Forget about tedious micromanagement and waiting for ships to be built. In Slipways, every action you take has immediate consequences, and every choice you make is of paramount importance. Your planets govern themselves while you focus on making the right decisions to get them what they need. You'll waste none of your precious time on busywork. A single run takes 40-60 minutes and they are all filled with the good stuff. TECH IT UP A NOTCH There are no boring technologies here. Instead of making a single building 20% more efficient, technologies in Slipways let you move planets at will, harness stars for energy or colonize planets with sentient machines instead of people. The selection varies each run, so you'll have to plan carefully and adapt to the situation at hand. The path you choose will profoundly change your experience and the way you look at the game's planets and resources. ...ONE MORE GAME? When a single run takes no more than an hour, what you need is replayability. Almost everything in Slipways is procedurally generated and each sector of the galaxy offers wildly different challenges. To overcome these challenges, you'll enlist the help of the five races populating the empire, each with their own philosophical outlook, varied abilities and a dedicated slice of the technology tree. There are more than 80 technologies to choose from and you'll only be using about 10 of them each run. No two games are ever exactly alike. PLAY IT YOUR WAY The standard gameplay mode gives you 25 years to build the best empire you can, but there is more: a sandbox endless mode that allows you to experiment freely, and a ranked mode that lets you measure your skills against others around the world on pre-seeded maps. The game also features a campaign mode with 13 scenarios, each of them introducing a new twist and refreshing the gameplay: from mysterious, ancient structures from the dawn of the galaxy to strange spacetime rifts splitting the galaxy in two. Once unlocked by playing the campaign, the new mechanics can also be used in other modes, becoming new options for even more varied runs.",1621,27540.79,1351,941,73,True,2021

You choose what weapons to purchase, what armor to wear, and what cybernetic modifications to enhance them with. You fight in a series of battles featuring a mix of maps, enemy groups, and tactical game play, which make sure every battle is fresh and unique. Synth Wars Tactics doesn't use a traditional grid based system, instead all actions cost your units action points, and your units can move anywhere on the battlefield that their action points allow. Synth Wars Tactics battles also feature objectives on the battlefields, which grant strategic intelligence each turn for whichever side controls them. When a player gains enough strategic intelligence, they can call down a stratagem to affect the battle. Ranging from Gunship air strikes, to missiles, or orbital deployed land mines, controlling objectives and smartly using call downs will separate good commanders from the great ones. Each enemy leader also has their own unique set of call downs to fight back with. Synth Wars Tactics also features an orders system, where you can issue an order to your men giving them advantages and disadvantages for the turn. If you need to reach a far away objective, you might give the order to Advance, granting more move speed, but you trade off some weapon accuracy that turn. Learning when to use each order is key to victory. Finally after each successful mission, you will unlock new vendors in the shops, giving you more options to spend your hard earned cash. When playing a mission set, each victory grants you cash to upgrade your team for that run. Learning the best items to buy against each foe, along with the ever changing maps and enemy strategies gives you infinite replay ability.",2,1.98,2,1034,0,True,2021

These badass forestry vehicles feature realistic steering, suspension, gear shifts, and transmission. For truck enthusiasts, these vehicles will be familiar – the models straight out of the logging industry. You set the controls too, changing the drive mode depending on the terrain that you need to cross. Don't get stuck! The map is an open world, its details numerous and filled with challenges. From high slopes to varying surfaces, there is plenty to look out for, and you need to stay focused in order to deliver your logs to their final destination (and keep your truck intact).
