Try World of Guns: the world’s most realistic 3D simulator of firearms (and other things from tanks to DeLorean time machines). Find out what makes legendary pistols, rifles, machine guns and artillery pieces tick… Then disassemble them down to the tiniest part! WHAT IS WORLD OF GUNS: VR? A free-to-play game and an interactive encyclopedia, simulating real firearms. Here, you can literally climb inside a gun and understand its workings; cut it in half, fire it and bring time to a crawl; and finally, completely disassemble it and put it back again (against the clock if you wish). WoG meticulously recreates historical and modern examples of firearm designer genius — from a tiny Liberator pistol to a 16000-pound FlaK 88 anti-aircraft gun. It has both legendary World War guns and rare models that even museums struggle to find. World of Guns puts 200 years of firearm history into a single, sleek and engaging video game. 206 MODELS AND 25 700 PARTS Here you are guaranteed to find something that catches your fancy: • sleek &amp; modern Glocks, P90s, M4s and Tavors • guns steeped in history like Colt SAAs, Garands and Lee-Enfields • a vast arsenal of Soviet-bloc guns, from various AKs to the rarest VSS Vintorez • a dainty pocket derringer or a fire-breathing M134 Minigun • a .22 sporting Ruger or a mighty .55-caliber Boys Anti-Tank rifle Not only WoG covers most important models in firearm history, but also the most popular screen divas like Desert Eagle and SPAS-12. TONS OF GAME MODES AND FEATURES Every model includes: • modes for learning operation, handling, and field stripping the gun; • the armorer mode where you can completely disassemble the firearm; • timed game modes, including a hardcore mode and a high scores table. See every detail with the fully controllable camera, layered X-Ray feature and a Cutaway mode, along with complete time control including a slow-motion feature down to 50x. You’ll even see the gasses flow inside a gas block! The game also features: • 10 shooting ranges with timed objectives (from Glocks to RPG-7s) • paint mode that lets you create custom weapon skins • minigames and quizzes with XP prizes UNPARALLELED REALISM World of Guns has been used as a learning aid by armorers, law enforcement and military personnel. To create each model, our team spends months poring over actual guns, photos, blueprints and documents. Each part out of hundreds functions in a physically correct way – exactly as it does in a real thing. There are few ways to understand the different firearm actions and systems as clearly. CONSTANT UPDATES Noble Empire releases several new models every month, and improves the older ones. Majority of our models can be unlocked for free by anyone; power players will be able to achieve 100% completion and unlock ALL the gun models without spending a dime.",60,0.0,-12,1471,64,True,2019

The story of an inventor called Iqbal and of the first telephone mines in India. In a country stitched with telephone wires, it is not surprising to discover that a history of the telephone was first written in a book of Geology. The telephone is after all a noticeable fixture of the Indian landscape. And it's sonorous ringing has long heralded sudden and momentous changes in the minute destinies of its people. The instrument can be found, amplifying the terrifying horns of Babur's army from the ragged edge of Chenab . Or clattering with the shouts of Chalukya craftsmen, that once echoed along the Badami temples. It is even heard across time, like the chiseling of Ashoka's inscriptions that would manifest as an unresolved ringing in the inner ear of James Prinsep. Or when William Brooke O'Shaughnessy believed that, much like cholera riddled veins, these telegraph cables would let him pump restoratives straight into the heart of a troubled nation. In this country of telephones and wires, phone directories become genealogies, telephone exchanges become places of pilgrimage and the ringing, clicking drone of its machinery - a metronome of the sporadic history of this land.

Alcatas island is famous for the dark history associated with the most haunted prison in Alcatas. The prison was built in 1859 initially as the U.S. Military defense and then as long-term military prison during 1868. Long before the prison was even built on the land, there was a rumor going around that the land was haunted. The place had an unpleasant feeling from the very beginning as the earliest inhabitants of the land were the Native Americans. Fast forward to the early 1940s, it was reported that there were some prisoners who were shot to death by jail guards, some of them were punished inside a punishment chamber by various means including the beatings, electric shock treatment etc. It had resulted in deaths of some of the prisoners and their spirits were trapped inside the prison. Now, the majority of the jail is closed due to various reasons except the A-Block. No prisoners are kept in B, C and D-Block due to many reports of the paranormal events. It is reported that sounds of cell door slamming, voices, gunshots, scream etc. can still be heard to this day. Anyone who enters the building has some sort of unexplained paranormal experiences even though the people at the Alcatas main office located in the west of Alcatas Island are in denial about the paranormal. At present, only two jail guards are recruited to maintain the tight security of the prison. No one usually visits the punishment chamber due to lots of tragedy, pain, suffering which are associated with it. You play as one of the jail guards whose mission is to secure the building. It is easier said than done because you never know what else is waiting for you in the Haunted Prison. Key Features: Explore the Haunted Prison and experience the paranormal.

42971,大时代：三国立志,2019-05-15,19.99,0,FunLight Studio,FunLight Studio,"Action,Indie,RPG,Simulation,Strategy","我们是一个3人工作室，这是第一次接触Steam，游戏有官方讨论群： 官方QQ1群：334178073 官方QQ2群：490366789 官方QQ3群：116022382 官方QQ4群：543776026 以下是一些玩法介绍 一些开始时玩家最想知道的人物所在地： 三位神医：董奉，张仲景，华佗 分别在：桂阳，南阳，许昌 三维铁匠：蒲元，郭达，郑浑 分别在：成都，济南，洛阳 铁匠除了出售武器和教授才艺，其中有的还能鉴定物品或图纸 至关重要的人际关系系统 所有结交朋友，招募武将，学习才艺，结拜结婚等玩法，都是基于人际关系的。增加人际关系的重要手段是送礼，其次是生病时送药或需要帮忙时提供帮助。 送礼时，礼品的品质决定了效果，而对方兴趣爱好则会加倍效果。比如一本史记品质为4，送给一个武将，则最少增加4点关系，若对方的爱好是书籍，则会增加8点关系。 以下是一些关系条件 加入势力，需要与君主关系达到一颗心（4点） 学习才艺，需要与对方关系达到两颗心（8点） 结拜和结婚，需要与对方关系达到四颗心（16点） 招募武将，关系可以增加成功率。 战斗系统增加了种类，现在分为：攻城战，野战，探险，打猎，单挑等几种。 攻城战只能由君主发起，主角能够参与本势力发起的任何攻城战，或本势力的城市被攻击时，可参与守城战。攻城战中，玩家控制自己部队，与其他武将一起进行战斗。 野战是指在野外发起的，与强盗乱军等，或其他势力武将进行的战斗。这是最常见的战斗，玩家可控制自己部队进行战斗，随行好友也会参与。 探险是指在特定地点触发的战斗，一般是洞穴或野外。这种探险以获得物品，图纸或称号为目的。参与战斗的只有玩家和伙伴，没有士兵。 打猎是以获得猎物皮毛或肉为目的的活动。主角和伙伴可以参与，没有士兵。但是打猎途中可以随时结束。 单挑就是指一对一战斗，一般在武馆进行，单挑只是切磋武功，不会导致主角死亡。 疾病系统 游戏里武将会生病，生病不但是显示健康状态不同，同时也会降低武将能力。 比如战斗失败会变成“受伤', 受伤并并不降低能力，可用伤药治好。但是，若受伤不管，再次战败会变成'重伤'，重伤会导致生命值减半。重伤的治疗可以吃复命丹，也可看医生。 多次淋雨和冒风雪会的风邪（就是感冒）风邪会导致精力值减半。吃神气丸或看医生可治疗。 长时间不睡觉，会体虚。体虚会导致防御能力变为1点。可吃灵犀丸或看医生治疗。 肾亏会导致攻击力变为1点，肾亏可吃豹筋丹或看医生治疗。 重要的一点，除了'受伤'以外的疾病，一旦得了就尽快治疗，不然战斗失败就会退出游戏。 另外一旦看到生病的武将，而你送他对症的药物，他就会治愈病情，而且大副增加好感！ 才艺系统 才艺用来定义武将的能力。 才艺的设计与现实中概念相近，比如学习兵法可以学会指挥部队的命令，而学习马术可以获得称号从而骑更高级的马。游戏中的主动技能，称号，菜谱，药方等等都会通过学习才艺而获得。 基础的五项才艺：木工，石工，采矿，采药，钓鱼，是通过不断使用来积累经验升级。 其他的才艺则需要向武将学习，武将能教会主角的才艺不会超过自己的才艺等级。所以要想学到高级别的才艺，就需要找到此项才艺的顶尖武将才行。 称号系统 称号相当于被动技能，一些称号可以获得新的玩法，一些称号获得数值加成。 本游戏中的所有特殊兵种都有与之对应的称号，获得称号后才能训练出特殊兵种。 主动技能 在人物的属性界面里有一个“特技”按钮，里面记录了主角学会的所有主动技能， 主动技能包括部队的命令，战斗是的大招，战场上的计策等。 主动技能一开始并没有，可以通过学习才艺获得。所有主动技能，都需要玩家手动来触发。并且只能选择三个主动技能设置对应按键。所以如何搭配主动技能，也决定了主角在战场上的战术。 带兵系统 部队每天都会消耗同等人数的粮食，若军粮不足，会导致士气下降，士气为0后会开始出现逃兵。 本作中，士兵的来源主要有两种，一种是在村庄中，找村长募集民兵，然后自己培养。 每个士兵都有自己的属性，比如攻击，防御，生命，经验值。其中经验值在战斗中获取，经验值满了之后，就可以升级了。 但是，升级训练士兵是一个专业的活，需要玩家的角色有对应的教官称号才行。比如学习兵法到2级时，会获得正规军教官的称号，有这个称号后，才可以升级正规部队。 有些特种士兵的训练需要相应的称号，要在一些特殊的地点，通过战斗来获得。比如藤甲兵，就需要获得藤甲兵教官称号后才能训练。当然虎豹骑是个例外，可在曹操剧情中获得。 除了从民兵训练升级而来的正规部队，还存在一些野外的非正规部队，比如山贼，强盗，流寇等等。 这些部队可以通过战斗胜利后，俘虏士兵来获得。 一般情况下，这些非正规部队，是不能进行训练升级的。除非你遇到传说中的黑阎王... 所以部队的士兵来源有两种： 一种是村庄里招募民兵， 一种是战斗胜利俘虏士兵。 两种来源的士兵都可以进行训练升级。 但需要相应的教官称号。 说完兵源，来说一生命值。士兵在战斗中会损耗生命值，战斗结束后，应该尽量对受伤士兵就行救治，使用伤药可对单个士兵就行疗伤。 每过一天，部队中士兵都会恢复一些生命值，所以只有一段时间不打战，或者住旅馆，士兵的生命都会自动恢复。对于有势力阵营的玩家，还可以在军营教官处对士兵进行集体恢复。 所以士兵恢复生命共有三种方法： 紧急用伤药，平时靠时间，主动找军官。 如何自立为王 本作的自立为王，不使用收集神器这种神话般的方式，也不依托某个神秘人物。 而是还原自立本来的面目，自己选一个起义的据点，获得当地百姓的支持，然后举旗自立。 经过修改后的条件是：自己个人的名气+在当地的声望-自己的恶名，大于160时，和村长对话就有自立的剧情选项了。 自己的名气，通过战斗，比武等可提高。当地的声望，则需要在当地完成委托。 恶名？不要做坏事就行 如何管理势力 三国大时代中，有多个势力，比如刘备，曹操，孙权，刘表等。表现为一个君主带着若干武将，管理着若干城池。在本作中，只有身为君主才能发动战争。 君主管理势力的地方在衙门，进入衙门内，往里走，可以看到里面摆放着这是三样物件 桌子可以触发内政的管理。 有山和城模型的可以触发战争。 香炉用来触发外交。 触发战争时，先选择要攻打的城市， 再选择要出战的武将。 需要注意的是， 进攻城市并不需要亲自前往。 如果派出的武将厉害，几个月后就可占领目标。 招募武将 首先，每个人都有性格值，性格相近的人更容易招募成功。 另外其他势力的武将能不能招呢？实际上，无论在野武将还是势力武将都有可能被招募。 如果是在野武将，招募成功的几率决定于人物性格和人物关系。 如果是势力武将呢，招募成功要比在野难，而且将军以上职位，和忠义之人，是不会背叛君主的。 开局怎么玩 严格来讲，本作并没有主线剧情，也没有可以按部就班的攻略路线，本作只是提供了一些机制，供玩家自己选择发展路线。 游戏开始时，主角身上有6666钱，一把剑，一件布衫和三种药，第一个与老者的对话结束后，还可以得到一本史记。 觉得钱不够的玩家可以选择卖掉一些东西，其实这些物品就算全部卖了游戏也可以玩下去。 这里就单说一下史记的用途，史记的品质是4点，意味着若把史记送给武将可以增加一颗心的关系，若这个武将的爱好是刚好是书籍，则可以增加双倍--两颗心的关系。 一颗心意味着可以加入势力，两颗心意味着可以学习才艺，所以愿意加入势力的玩家，只要把史记送给任何一位君主，就可以加入这位君主的势力。 而喜欢先提升自己的玩家，找一位喜欢书籍的武将，只有送出这本史记，就可以开始学习了。 不知道谁喜欢书籍？多打听一下见闻就可以了哦！比如出身地雁门就有个喜欢书籍的王异。 当然你要是喜欢采集制造休闲度日，只有把史记卖了，就有几千的创业基金了，不也很好。 游戏一开始，就想出去打山贼赚钱的，只要你操作够好，也不是什么难事，要是手残党，还是先学点武艺再战斗的好。",29,579.7099999999999,-9,1691,0,True,2019

It takes a hero to be one of those men who goes into battle.' -Norman Schwarzkopf On August 2, 1990, Iraq’s ground forces invaded and occupied Kuwait. 40% of the world’s oil production, and the developed world’s economy, was placed in imminent threat by Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein. In response, the United States promptly assembled an international coalition to attack and expel Iraqi forces out of Kuwait, and to eliminate Hussein’s capability to repeat such an act in the future. What followed would forever transform the face of war. Desert Storm was the first truly high-tech war. It was the first conflict watched live by millions across the world, 24/7. It was the first time that air power decisively defeated ground forces on its own. It featured a logistics build-up that exceeded WW2’s D-Day. For the first time an entire nation’s command and control apparatus was abruptly and effectively removed at the very start of a conflict; and the first time that stealth, standoff and precision-guided weapons were used on a mass scale. For students of military technology and art, this was effectively the first war of the 21st century. Relive the pivotal events of the conflict that sealed the Cold War and radically changed the Middle East geopolitical landscape: The massive coalition build-up following the Iraqi invasion; The first night over Baghdad on January 17, 1991; the “do or die” strike that stopped Iraq’s chemical retaliation in the nick of time; the frustrating “Scud hunts” all over the Iraqi desert; coalition attacks on Iraq’s airfields; the annihilation of the Iraqi navy at Bubiyan, the “highway of death” during the Iraqi retreat from Kuwait, and much more. Additionally, step into the unknown as you probe the great unanswered questions of the conflict: What if Iraq had pre-empted the coalition build-up and rolled right into S.Arabia? What if Israel had retaliated for the Scud attacks against it? What if Iran or even the Soviet Union had intervened against the coalition? “Command - Desert Storm” is a new DLC/Standalone release for Command: Modern Air/Naval Operations, the premier game of air, naval &amp; strategic warfare and the choice of serious hobbyists and defence professionals alike.

Step into the chaos of a magical England at the end of the Third Crusade. Maid Marian hides breathless amidst the brambles after the sack of her father’s castle; Little John charges a bodyweight in gold to cross a lonely log; and Will Scarlet holds court in a brokedown tower surrounded by trees as tall as the sky, waiting for a king who will never come.

The Game Nocked! is a lushly-illustrated, story-driven role-playing game.

It is a survival sandbox with crew management mechanics while its primary theme is life of German sailors. The boat is their home, but it can become their grave at any time. In UBOAT you control the crew in order to control the boat. You look after their physical and mental health, because if the sailors are hungry, tired and their spirit is low, there’s no chance of winning even a skirmish. Survival The extensive damage system is a foundation of the game's survival elements. Unprecedented situations are bound to happen as the effect of received damage, testing player's creativity and ability to stay calm. You can try to save the whole crew or leave someone behind, to save the others. While your ship travels through the open seas, you will often find yourself being on your own. Use your management skills to spend resources taken on the trip optimally and in special cases try to recover them on the sea, by asking your allies for the help... or by looting wreckages of enemy ships. Disable unnecessary devices, to keep your accumulators running for longer. Tell your crew to stay in their bunks to preserve oxygen. If crew's morale is low - play with them a session of Skat or play music from nearby radio stations, to fortify their hearts. Kriegsmarine career During the playthrough you will receive assignments from the Kriegsmarine headquarters. They are never linear and you may receive additional orders during them or face unexpected problems. Brave completion of assignments from the headquarters is rewarded with additional budget for the unit under your command and with acceptance of your growing reputation as an u-boat's skipper. You will need that, to upgrade your ship and keep up with enemy's technological advances. Upgrade your boat for the rewarded funds. Receive additional permissions for the reputation points. Buy new equipment - new torpedo types, sonar decoys, CO2 absorbers and much more. Send your officers on special tasks in the headquarters to, among other things, speed up a research of new technologies. Accurate simulation Game's simulation elements are very realistic, but that never comes at a cost of gameplay quality. Despite extensive simulation elements, UBOAT can be played like a regular game and complex matters can be learned later to become a better skipper for the commanded unit. Even small things like the influence of ballast in each compartment on the ship's trim (tilt) or Earth's curvature are faithfully reproduced in the game. Perfection can be achieved in many ways. Prove your management skills and swiftly assign work to your officers to speed things up. If, on the other hand, you think that if something needs to be done, it's better to do that on your own - sit behind the periscope, hydrophone or 88 mm deck gun and take matters in your own hands!",13819,414431.81,8151,1706,0,True,2019

The overlapping blasts from the initial explosion add up to a huge amount of damage at the epicenter, while the seeking clusters handle crowd control. Example Build #2: Celestial Shield-Bomber Hullbreaker + Amp Shield + Volatile Shields + Flash Shielding + Emergency Systems + Celestial Lance This build takes advantage of the Hullbreaker's speed and resilience to crash damage to slam directly into enemies. The fragile Amp Shield is used not for defense, but to augment Hullbreaker's strongest aspects, gaining increased speed and force. The shield will break on impact, but we can capitalize on that using the Volatile Shields mod, which detonates the shield when it goes down, blasting all nearby enemies. Flash Shielding gets it running again quickly while Emergency Systems grant a moment of damage immunity, making charge attacks safer.

When playing in clear conditions its easy to target and spot other players and combat is clear and open. When playing in rainy or snowy conditions however, there are winds howling and particles that fill the air. These elements make visibility a challenge. Games can be played in daytime or at night time. In day time there is naturally a lot of light, making warfare open and frontal. At night time a more stealthy approach is often needed as visibility is low and enemies can be hard to spot. With over 55 weapons to choose from there is a massive arsenal to select and play with. World war one warfare has never been so versatile and open with multiple versions of pistols, sub-machine guns, machine guns, rifles, shotguns each with unique skins, attachments, animations and audio. Each weapon feels lifelike and unique when you use it, making for realistic gunfights. Guns have unique ballistic, spray pattern, fire speed and weight values - just like the real thing. Apart from guns there are also multiple unique grenades and melee weapons to choose from, making warfare even more versatile and chaotic. Grenades have varying damage and range values, making each deadly in a unique way. Grunt1914 features a unique and exciting class system that is unlike anything else. There are 6 classes to choose from, each with a unique active and passive ability. The active ability gives the player an item or asset that they can use to turn the tide of the battle. The passive ability gives the player a unique buff that only that class enables. As an example of the active and passive abilities lets look at the Avian class. The active ability for this class is a landmine that can be placed, so as to set a trap for an enemy. The passive ability for this class is a parachute, which ensures that this class doesn't take fall damage. Each class has unique abilities like these. Classes can be selected regardless of the selected character or team. Travel all around the locations of history with 16 true to life world war one maps to play in. Maps are varied in size, location and style and each one is unique and offers something new. Maps range from African to American to European locations and includes everything in between. Some maps have allot of cover and shelter while others allow for more open warfare to ensue. Some maps are blocked of and walled in while others are open ended and expansive. These variations offer different types of gunfights and experiences. Maps support up to 20 players with a variety of game modes on each available. In Grunt1916 there are two factions to play as, the Americans and the Germans. Each player can select their own unique character to play as and fight with. Each faction has three unique characters that can be selected. All the weapons in the game as well as the abilities can be selected regardless of which faction or character is being used.

The heroes will grow and mature as the game progresses, and each will play an important role in its resolution. Trials of Guinevere explores many themes, such as the origins of personal strength, loyalty and betrayal, the meaning of sacrifice, and redemption. Storyline Guinevere is a regal city-state, located in the center of the continent, Vitaria. Home to over six million citizens, Guinevere is known for its proud people and kindhearted rulers. Commerce is at an all time high, and Guinevere is famed for its fishermen, craftsmen, and Arcanist enchanters. However, Guinevere's fate wasn't always so bright. Eighteen years ago, a dangerous conqueror, known as the Warlord, sought to claim the city for himself. He planted spies and soldiers everywhere, in attempts to sow chaos and destruction. As a final blow, he managed to fatally poison the king, Leorus III. However, two heroes were chosen before the King passed: a young Frostbringer named Uriel, and his girlfriend, a Brawler, Lowangen. Together with a master of metaphysics, Kei, and a priest of Llymayn, Vhaldir, the heroes stopped the Warlord's forces and saved their home from destruction. Because of their actions, Guinevere has enjoyed almost two decades of peace. Now, a new threat emerges from within the city, and it just might be a reminder of the events of Guinevere's past... Combat Trials of Guinevere 's combat is turn-based and continuous, with mechanics that are easy to grasp, yet enjoyable to master. The combat of ToG focuses on the classes of its characters. The people of Vitaria that show proficiency in magic are known as mages, while those that have trained in melee or ranged combat are known as fighters. These two categories form the basis for many classes, and all have unique spells and/or abilities in battle. The Alchemist is a mage that excels in stacking powerful poisons upon his foes, while the Templar is a fighter that defends her allies in battle through prayers to her Goddess. There are no 'useless useful spells' in the game, and it will be up to you to use each spell and ability effectively. Status effects play an important role in turning the tide of battle. Is there an enemy Priestess in the backline, protected from your fighter? You can silence her, stopping her magic for a few rounds. A powerful Barbarian that deals great damage to your frontliners can be feared, giving you a chance to defeat him before he recovers. Each character has their own strengths, weaknesses, and immunities. Character strength is measured in Power Levels, and each comes with two abilities or spells, and possible upgrades to existing ones. There are multiple aspects that enhance combat, from Free Actions, limited use spells, Concentration, and powerful items and salves. Characters Lane Conway Lane is a young student of Guinevere's Academy of Magic. Bored with the monotonous routine of school life, he yearns to explore the world beyond the Academy's walls. Lane is very lighthearted, and while he doesn't excel in his studies, he is skilled in the practical side of magic. Lane has been an orphan since his childhood, raised in Guinevere's Peoples' District. Amber Aveyonde Lane's classmate and best friend, Amber is almost a polar opposite, compared to him. She takes her studies very seriously, and is intrigued by the Eldyrians. While Lane spends time with friends, Amber is studying. She is very knowledgeable in Ancient Eldyr, the language of the incredibly powerful Ancient Eldyrian Spells. Morgan DesCallier Morgan is a kindhearted girl that can't remember much of her childhood. She was born in what she believes is a castle, so her biggest hope is that she is a princess. She believes that once she has found her family, and her calling, she can help many people. Morgan is very optimistic in her views of the world, but she lacks confidence in herself. Teo Northmere Like his friends, Teo is a second year student at the Academy of Magic.

En effet, son association étudiante a adopté une campagne sur l'environnement, et suite à une escalade des moyens de pression, il est temps de mobiliser pour une journée de grève! De la mob aux tables Dans Tractage aux portes 2: Mob à la cafétéria , vous saisissez de nouveau votre pile de tracts pour cette fois, aller faire de la mobilisation one on one . Allez vous asseoir et discutez avec des étudiantes et des étudiants pour les convaincre de venir à leur assemblée générale de grève et de se voter en faveur de celle-ci! Chaque personne dans la cafétéria a des opinions différentes sur la campagne et sur la grève. Vous devrez savoir gager les groupes, et trouver les arguments qui réussiront à les mobiliser. Toutefois, faites attention. La mobbeuse n'est pas la seule à faire son retour en force dans ce jeu: Capitaine Douchebag et Sergent CAQ sont eux aussi dans la caféteria, et auront certainement envie de faire entendre leur opinion, si la mobbeuse décide de venir parler à leur groupe! Un outil d'apprentissage « C'est en mobbant qu'on devient un mobbeux ou une mobbeuse. » - Proverbe militant Faire de la mobilisation, c'est plutôt facile, mais intimidant quand on n'en a jamais fait. Le meilleur moyen de devenir bon ou bonne à faire de la mobilisation, c'est de saisir une pile de tracts ou de journaux et d'aller les distribuer aux tables de la cafétéria. Ce jeu a pour objectif de simuler une séance de mobilisation, mais pas de la remplacer! Questions et réponses Pourquoi ce jeu existe-t-il? Pourquoi pas? Plus sérieusement, Tractage aux Portes: Le Jeu Vidéo a marqué l’imaginaire militant étudiant. Au cours des mois qui ont suivi sa diffusion initiale, une pluie de commentaires et suggestions a été reçue pour améliorer ce jeu. Lorsqu’est venu le temps de développer un nouveau jeu, il a été décidé de prendre toutes ces suggestions, sans exception, et les utiliser comme base pour un nouveau jeu, et d’aller plus loin encore. Est-ce que ce jeu comporte des formules de “loot boxes”? Vous voulez dire des ballots d’Ultimatums ? Non, malheureusement, les Ultimatums et les Argumentaires ne feront pas leur réapparition dans Mob à la Cafétéria . Est-ce que c’est un simulateur de mobilisation? Le terme “Jeu de rôle non linéaire en monde ouvert” est préféré, où le joueur ou la joueuse incarne la même mobbeuse que lors de Tractage aux portes: Le jeu vidéo , et où le monde ouvert est de la taille d’une petite cafétéria. Il ou elle peut décider d’aller mobiliser les tables de son choix, dans l’ordre de son choix. Ça doit être rapidement répétitif non? Pour augmenter la rejouabilité et la diversité du jeu, il a été déterminé dès le départ qu’une grande partie du jeu sera généré aléatoirement et dynamiquement avant le début de chaque partie. Il en est de même pour les opinions et points de vue de chaque personne dans la cafétéria.

55494,GameLibBooster,2019-03-01,19.99,0,Nurgo Software,Nurgo Software,Utilities,"GameLibBooster is the first disk optimization software dedicated to PC gamers. Faster loading Always run your games from your fastest drive GameLibBooster analyses the performance of your drives and the file structure of your games, and ensures that the games you play are always on the most suited drive. The improvement can be very noticeable, as moving a game from HDD to SSD usually results in 2 to 3 times faster loadings. A RAMDisk can even be used to get a better performance optimization. Less loading lags Game freezes when entering a new area? This annoying FPS drop occurs when your drive isn’t fast enough to load all the game assets needed to render the scene. By moving the games that you’re playing to your fastest drive, GameLibBooster can noticeably reduce or even eliminate the occurrence of this stuttering. Faster level streaming See the battlefield before your enemies To limit RAM usage, most open world games only keep into memory the areas of the map that surround the player; this programming technique is called lazy loading. But the negative effect of this technique is that you can often see chunks of level, objects and texture details popping-in as you move around. GameLibBooster can greatly reduce this effect by making game data load faster. Better disk usage More room for your games Having to uninstall an old game to free up space for a new one is a thing of the past. GameLibBooster automatically makes the best use of all your drives. Games you no longer play are moved to your larger drive. As soon as you play them again, they are moved back to your fastest drive. Your save files are preserved, and you don't need to re-download your games again and again. Fully automated Install, configure and forget You have nothing to do, your games are always optimized. Just install your Steam games as usual, GameLibBooster takes care of the rest. GameLibBooster only works when you don't use your computer, and keeps your games optimized without affecting performance. Easy to configure 3, 2, 1, your games are optimized! Setting up GameLibBooster is only a matter of minutes. Your game directories are automatically detected. Just tell GameLibBooster how much space on each drive can be used for games, and that's it! GLibBBot, our smart advisor, will even guide you through these steps.

Use your funds to add more ships to your fleet and expand your reach to new solar systems. Grow Your Empire Research new technologies to unlock better ships and higher-quality planets. Upgraded planets work faster and produce new, valuable goods, but they also have additional demands. You must meet all the demands of a planet to upgrade it to a higher tier, so continually evolving your network is a challenging and rewarding puzzle. Build an increasingly complex web of trade routes until you run a trading empire for the history books. Automation Planets periodically produce goods. Once you've defined a trade route, configured its import/export policies, and assigned a ship to it, that ship will automatically ply that route for you, constantly bringing in money for you to use in other parts of your expansion. These routes need no maintenance, and the resources never expire, so any changes you make are your own choice. Once you've set up your network, kick back and watch your empire automatically generate money for you as you plan your next addition – at your pace. Simple and Complex The mechanics of the game are straightforward: define a trade route from one planet to another, shipping a produced good to a planet that demands it. However trade routes cannot cross, and your company can only operate a limited number of ships. As you upgrade planets, you'll need to start transporting new goods across a densely established network to unconnected planets that are difficult to reach now. You'll drop off and pick up goods at many stops before they make it to their destination. Deciding how to allocate and transport limited resources in an dense ecosystem is a challenging puzzle that will entertain for hours and hours. Manufactured Technology In order to acquire new technology, you must manufacture and consume technology tiers - a special good that must be manufactured from other goods.

Your path gets started by investing and capturing the most profitable companies. Achieve financial wealth by buying out companies, building monopolies which in turn help you to lobby laws and politicians, corrupt officials. You’ll be able to make political intrigues as well as play the game of big business by putting sticks in the wheels. In front of you will open tens of years of history with hundreds of significant events. You can influence the aftermath World Wars, make an economic crisis by using the earned money and influence. Build the most powerful financial empire and become a shadow ruler of the world! A plutocracy is a form of society defined as being ruled or controlled by a function of wealth. The main idea of the game is to show the interaction of the economy with politics and how influential capitalists make an impact inside and outside politics using the money. In this game, a player can immerse himself in the real world of capitalists with all the vicissitudes and intrigues as well as feel how the player's decisions change the economies of countries where politicians become his puppets. Every law or official decree has an end customer! Achieve the game’s goals in many ways! Only you decide whether to compete openly or secretly. Whether to make a bet on the economic development of their companies or investment in them with the support of influential officials and politicians? To be the richest and influential person in the world and make peoples’ lives better by changing the political course of continents? Every way has its consequences! The responsibility of your choices will be going up with every level of the game. Scalability is what we’re seeking while designing our game. In the beginning, a little depends on you because you don’t start the game as a president or a billionaire. You build everything from the scratch. Gradually the workers of your companies, their families, industries, regions, and even countries and continents begin to depend on you. You will start feeling the growth of your responsibility for every decision you make. The game has a real dynamic mechanism of economic companies and the country. Having achieved the scale levels, you’ll be able to influence prices, GDP, unemployment and etc of the whole country and also of the whole world. We know how excessive micromanagement is tiresome so we’ve made both manual and automatic process management inside companies. You can hire directors and they’ll take care of all the routine processes! Make the most suitable strategy for the current realities of the market and delegate management tasks to the Board of Directors. In the game, you can modify the production plan for workers, increase or decrease working hours and wages. It’ll lead to a reduction of administrative expenses and a wage-fund but at that same time, it’ll instigate a strike and an increased level of an accident in a company. All the staff will be in a rage, trade unions will take up arms against you but your profitability will go up! A strike will influence the production volume, companies will start seeing losses. Will you meet the demands of the demonstrators or disperse the crowd of the dissatisfied people with help of corrupt cops? Will you bleed the workers dry or inspire the staff to upgrade their skills? Every way has its consequences! It’s up to you to decide! It’s entirely in your hands! Having issued stocks and bonds, you’ll be able to capitalize on your company and conduct IPO. Make monopolies and trusts, expand the areas of influence and capture market shares as well as take over smaller companies. You have different ways of competing. Make a relationship with the companies' owners and collude with them, merging into cartels. Together, you can drop the prices of products on the market and squeeze out competitors and then make a monopoly by which you can raise the price of three folds! Organize strikes and sabotage at the companies of competitors, disrupt supplies and block logistics. The market is a living self-organizing matter in which the functioning of the industries is interrelated. For instance, you can buy out all transport companies in the region and increase the supply price for competitors several times as Rockefeller did it in the period of the seizure of the petroleum market. No one will want to work in the minus! As a result, competitors will be forced to sell their companies to you sooner or later. Will you have enough resources for that? Or you’ll be acting through loyal politicians and destroy the competitors by laws? Choose any of the 14 industries and take over the market. Destroy competitors, be ruthless on the way to achieving your goals! You can develop and improve the infrastructure of your companies because new technologies increase income! Build new buildings, expand the plan and get higher dividends. The game will give you the right to choose to be able to become economically powerful! In the game, the executive branch consists of officials of the federal and local levels. The governor is in charge of the state welfare, the treasurer of finance, the prosecutor and the police of law and order, the judges make decisions. During the game, you’ll see a simulation of the real processes of passing laws at the region and the entire country level. We tried thoroughly to simulate the political system of the United States. Politicians will be sorting out significant issues of financing, taxation, management, business, education, healthcare, migration, social programs and other. There is an opportunity to hire political lobbyists who will be able to find some arguments to promote your law or an unfavorable law against your competitors. On the one hand, you may sponsor the election campaigns of politicians and they’ll help you when you in need, you may collect dirt on them and use the mass media to your advantage to not leave a chance to those who refused to be your puppets. Necessary laws will open up new opportunities for you to increase your wealth. Become a manipulator in political circles, increase your status and make relationships with influential officials and politicians. The party of Republicans and Democrats have different ideologies. So if you adopt the policy of clan capitalism, the government will have less influence on the regulation of market relations, therefore you will be able to get the support of the Republicans. For instance, you can make a monopoly and lobby through a law that reduces corporate taxes. But be careful, it can make a federal budget deficit and the whole country will take up arms against you. Greed is not always good! You must be able to find a balance between all the parties and society levels so that your monopoly doesn’t collapse like a house of cards. However, if you need bills of the democratic part such as reducing unemployment, increasing wages and other stuff, then don’t miss the opportunity to lobby through the bill to sing and adopt it! Use politicians and officials for your own goals! Will, you improve the well-being of the population or will you only take care of your well-being? It’s up to you! Capture fields of strategically important resources in other countries and provoke military conflicts through the Senate of the US Congress or the White House. Give a loan to the parties for the military conflict, break down the economies of countries, create the financial crisis and coup d'etat to buy cheap assets! You can become the beneficiary of the most significant historical events or just create your own alternative history without wars and economic crisis. In the game, you can get used to the role of secret leaders who was creating and influencing the history. Appoint politicians and heads of states so that they unquestioningly carry out your orders. Do you need to increase the supply of unprocessed oil to your refineries? Help an ambitious politician to become the minister of the country you need and make a deal with him to get oil for a song. Become a financial support and an international banker for countries asking for need. If you want to play hard and dirty, you should use the agents of influence who are your assistants in difficult situations. There are more than 36 unique characters, divided into 12 categories, whose hands you can fight with competitors. Make political intrigues, hidden manipulative fraud and win competitors! You have a huge set of tools: you can use force methods such as arson and accidents, bank robberies and etc as well as you can use secret and cunning methods: organize strikes and block production to competitors, industrial espionage, influence the stock market, use the services of a journalist and the mass media and so on. But be careful, every illegal action is strictly punishable by the court of justice! Well, or make sure that the judge and the state attorney are on your side… The game has something around 15,000 characters including shareholders, officials, politicians who have their own interests, fears, ambitions and other stuff that you can use to influence them. Just imagine a game world in which all the characters interact with each other, buy shares, lobby their interests, try improving their lives. Organize routes (banquet hall) and make meaningful relationships among influential people as well as give gifts, help people realize their ambitions which in turn will help you get access to huge resources. Every character can conceal a threat or access to game resources down the line. Therefore, it is necessary for you to consciously make friends! Keep in mind that every “resident” is endowed with intellect and knows how to behave and calculates what to do one step ahead. In addition, he is also connected by the threads of friendship or enmity with other characters, forming his unique network of contacts. For example, if you improve your relationship with a businessman who has two influential friends in the Congress, then your relationship with those congressmen can become much easier which will open up new opportunities later. On the other hand, you will have the risk of starting a financial war with some 'oligarch' and his friends, if you stop getting along well with each other. Increase your social status by winning luxuries at the auction. Earn money on horse races betting on horses. The price of rare coins or paintings will go up! Don’t forget to buy houses to get annual rent; cars, yachts and planes are a measure of your luxurious life. Any property is a tool for making relationships: if someone collects rare coins or paintings so as you, then it will be easier to make friends with them because of common interests. The game starts in 1870 and continues till date. There is an inheritance system where you can leave a bequest to your heirs to go on playing for them! If one of the heirs has analytical abilities and pragmatism, then you should give a financial monopoly to him. If you think that someone is suitable for the position of Senator of the Congress, then you should take care of his election campaign in advance. Promote your relatives in official posts, divide spheres of influence and appoint them as managers of your companies. Build a clan network and capture all strategically important resources. Be ready to meet the opposition of other clans. The most powerful families in the game will be fighting for world influence.

BRING IT DOWN! challenges the player to demolish structures given a limited supply of explosives. Your grasp on physics will be heavily disputed as you make your way through a variety of levels and weapons. The CHARGE LAUNCHER is the quintessential razing tool, letting you set up explosives before detonating them in a single chain reaction. Gravity affects the charges more than any other type of ammo, so it's important to aim a little higher than you normally would aim if you're trying to aim accurately. Your charges can also bounce, so ricochet them off walls to get to hard to reach areas. The HAND CANNON is a brute-force tool of destruction, capable of launching high-mass cannonballs at breakneck speeds. What it lacks in explosive power can be regained through its sheer force and quantity. Cannonballs have the increased power needed to knock obstacles out of the way and off the building platform for maximum bonus points. The GUIDED BAZOOKA is a strange, but intensely accurate weapon capable of hitting buildings from any angle. Launch a rocket in the direction of your choosing then use the attached laser sight to guide the rocket to the place of detonation.

42775,Battle for Gaming,2019-01-09,6.99,0,Free Time Dev,Free Time Dev,"Action,Indie","I tried to incorporate excessively used monetization models as mechanics in the game. So you use DLCs (Downloadable Content) to upgrade yourself, you have to get random improvements from Lootboxes, paid with virtual currency. As ammunition, you use your banknotes and there are a bunch of Live Services to subscribe to, in order to gain boosts (for a price of course). No worries though, there are no real microtransactions in the game. In addition to the mechanics just mentioned, I added other additional systems to make for a replayable, engaging and fun game. ​ Description In the full version, there are two different game modes available. There is a story mode, where you can make your way through a storyline. Your choices matter, as there are multiple pathways and endings. The second mode is the Custom Game mode, where you can set your prefered settings and difficulty and try to achieve better and better high scores. In this demo version, you can only play the custom game without setting your own preferences. The enemies you face are Lootboxes with different attacks at their disposal. As you shoot your way through hordes of Lootboxes you earn DCs (Different Currencies – the in-game currency), which you can use to buy random rewards through Lootboxes. Those rewards are temporary improvements for this run only. During your playthrough, you also find so-called DLC fragments. You can use those to permanently upgrade different perks at the Centre (starting point of the level). The upgrades include things like your movement speed, your fire rate, the amount of ammunition you can carry, etc. But with DLC fragments you can also unlock a new weapon and the ability to dual wield. What else Also at some point, you will unlock the possibility to build up different combo points (there are several combos available at the end, for example, killing only red Lootboxes in a row, earns you bonus DCs. Or killing only one type of Lootboxes earns you bonus DC, etc…) You finish your combos with a melee attack, where you blink to an enemy and destroy it simultaneously. The enemies are randomly created, and you can also control how many enemies you want to face at a given time. More enemies mean you the possible rewards are exponentially higher but at the same time the risk of dying increases. The level itself is theoretically infinite and procedurally generated. But you have to stay in the vicinity of the Centre, as you need to come back to it for ammunition and upgrades (a little arrow points you the way though). You are also on a clock because there is a limited time until the invincible, deadly W-box starts to chase you. Once it reaches you, this run is over. But at least you keep all permanent upgrades for the next run. Game Features: First Person Shooter with a simple but recognisable art style Story mode with different paths and endings Custom Game mode lets you hunt for ever-higher high scores Enemies are hostile Lootboxes with different attacks Upgrade yourself through permanent upgrades Kills, Combo-kills and Melee strikes earn you temporary improvements Replayable, procedurally generated level with randomized layout and enemies You control the risk to reward ration for every battle",1,6.99,-1,1817,0,True,2019

You can move the player character by clicking and moving in the screen with the mouse. You can also use the keyboard arrow keys. If an enemy bullet or enemy hits the player's heart, the player will be damaged, and if HP is 0, the stage will fail (game over). The types of bullets fired by the player include bullets that fire straight forward only, bullets that fire widely forward, and bullets that move to chase nearby enemies. You can set different types of bullets for 'Main' and 'Sub', and switch between bullets during battle. For example, when there are a lot of small enemies, fire bullets that fire widely forward and defeat the enemies together, and when the boss does not move very much, switch to a bullet that fires straight forward only and attack intensively. It is a good idea to switch according to the situation. You can also use skills. Skills include skills that make powerful attacks, skills that can eliminate bullets fired by enemies, and skills that can heal HP. Default key settings Keyboard Z key: Use of skill Keyboard X key: Switch between 'Main' and 'Sub' Keyboard C key: Pause or Resume game Keyboard A key: Slow movement mode when moving characters using keyboard You can change these settings in the game. The controller can also be used, but the controller can only be used for player operations within the stage. Also, not all controllers are supported. We recommend using the keyboard and mouse. Bullets, skills, items, etc. can be obtained as a clear reward by clearing each stage. You can get it for each difficulty level. There are three types of difficulty: Easy, Hard, and Chaos. Chaos mode can be played by clearing all stages in Hard mode. The stage will continue to the boss battle after defeating small enemies. There is a little story, and the story goes on stage by stage. Each boss on each stage can practice independently. If it is difficult to clear the stage, practice each boss and understand how to avoid bullets before trying the stage. Each character (boss) has its own theme such as fire, flowers, bubbles, etc., and it will attack with the appearance based on the theme and character image. For example, a bullet in the shape of a flower moves as a flower blooms, or a bullet in the shape of a leaf moves so that its leaves sway. In Easy mode, the number of bullets is suppressed as much as possible, so it is not flashy in appearance, but in Chaos mode it is flashy in appearance, so it would be nice if you could enjoy the beauty of the appearance that the character's bullets form is. There is no in-app purchases. Finally, this game is an individual production game. Game programming, character illustrations, BGM, sound effects, English translation, promotion, etc. are created by one person. I believe you will enjoy this game.

And they allow readers to get right to the heart of the matter in question. Get up and close and personal with it. Really feel it. We wanted to make games that captured that short story essence.

And we didn't want to make games in an on-going episodic series where you have to wait for the next release before you can continue the story and find out what happens next. So, we created the Short Story Series , an anthology of five 1 to 2 hour long 1st person point-and-click adventure games.

With a focus on environmental interaction and progressive narrative through game-play, It Will Find You aims to provide an immersive experience where the world evolves in tandem with your decisions, and a dark, twisting narrative is slowly revealed through fully voice acted dialogue. It Will Find You follows Julia, a woman struggling with depression after tragedy has caused her life to fall apart. Needing some time away from the world, she returns to her now empty family home, seeking solace in her childhood. Arriving amidst a terrible storm, Julia quickly realises she is not alone, as a horrific entity stalks the once beautiful woodlands surrounding her family estate. Under the deafening roar of the raging storm, Julia will have to fight for survival against the creature, while plagued by horrific visions that make her question her own reality. With the climax, the curtain will be drawn back revealing a shocking conclusion that turns the game upon its head, in a shocking conclusion, you won't see coming. Build around a Master Event System, It Will Find You's dynamic narrative shifts in real time to match the players in game decisions, altering dialogue, AI behaviour, and narrative events. With 8 different endings available in It Will Find You, players will have to delve deep into Dellich Grove and uncover the Mysteries of Julia's home, discovering dark secrets, and revealing shocking truths. It Will Find You is a promise, not just a title. Julia is not alone in the woods, and the creature stalking her will not rest until it has claimed her life. Players will have to run, hide and defend themselves from the creature's onslaught, ultimately escaping, or becoming its next meal. It Will Find You is a fully voice acted experience narrated by professional actors from across the world. A lot of time was spent ensuring we found the best people for each role, recording them in a professional grade sound studio and then mixing them into our world to make the experience more immersive. The world of It Will Find is a dark and foreboding place, using dynamic, volumetric lighting and detailed environments to create an oppressive sense of isolation. From the shadowy forest to the warmth of Julia's family home, each setting is brought to life in Unity to create an immersive, engaging experience. In It Will Find You almost every object in the game is fully interact-able, with Julia able to pick up, rotate and investigate objects in the world around her. Players will need to use these skills to solve puzzles, find hidden clues, and ultimately escape. FAQ How many people worked on It Will Find You? The game has been a solely developed by myself as a passion project following from Captive Audience. Many voice actors, an awesome composer and some great rubber ducks have contributed along the way though. Is this a direct sequel to Captive Audience? Whilst the game is set in the same universe, it does not directly follow on from Captive Audience, and as such can be played without knowledge of the previous game, though it will definitely enhance the gameplay experience to have played it. How did It Will Find You come about? After finishing Captive Audience, I knew there were more stories to tell in the universe and began to plan out what could be explored next. At the time I was completing my Masters Degree in Games Design, and thought my final project would be the perfect opportunity to start developing the next step in the saga. From there it continued past graduation to where we are now! How many endings are there? Currently the game has 8 endings. Are there achievements? Yes! There are currently 33 achievements in game. Are there subtitles? Yes! The game is fully subtitled. Is there controller support? Not at the moment, keyboard and mouse are required to play. Did you make the 3D models that populate the game? No, I am a terrible 3D modeller and so relied on royalty free assets from websites such as turbo-squid, and the unity asset store. A full list of artists can be found in the credits. Some custom models were also created by Gary Gough, the artist from Captive Audience. Who made the music? Stefanos Yiassemides was the composer for It Will Find You and created all tracks except for the trailer music. Feel free to show him some love for the awesome work he did! Where can I see a list of your voice actors? All voice actors are fully credited in the game, so definitely let them know what a great job they did! Will there be future updates to the game? Whilst there will definitely be fixes and performance patches, content updates are less certain. This is due to working a full time job around solo development, and the fact I believe this story is complete. Will there be another chapter in the Captive Audience Saga? 6 titles including Captive Audience and It Will Find You have been planned out, but the continuation of the series will depend on the success of this title. That being said I love the universe that’s slowly coming into being and would love to delve further into it. If you have any further questions please feel free to drop me a message, or comment and i'll aim to reply asap : )",9,8.91,3,1518,33,True,2019

You are a ship’s captain, buying and selling wares in order to keep your bucket o' bolts afloat and stay one step ahead of pirates, organised criminals, corrupt governments and shady laws. A galaxy of characters await you in Objects in Space. The game focuses on a myriad of short stories rather than one main storyline with a hero’s journey, so it’s up to you how much or how little narrative you want in your game. Combat in Objects sees ships treated more like Cold War submarines than WWII dogfighters. You’ll be running silent, planning manoeuvres far ahead of time and engaging in deadly games of cat-and-mouse with nebulous enemies, but only for those players who seek it out. Combat-averse players can pay attention to the news and avoid pirate-heavy systems and choose not to explore the deadly uncharted areas of space where greater numbers of pirates lurk. It’ll be up to you to keep your ship’s systems running as quietly as possible, going fully ‘dark’ if you have to, just floating with your current trajectory and speed hoping to avoid showing up on anyone else’s scanners as you traverse some of the most dangerous shipping lanes in space.  To make your money, there are over fifty employers and your reputation with each one will dictate how many passenger, cargo or bounty-hunting contracts are available to you. But be warned - failure to complete a contract might see your rep plummet with that employer. So when you get an SOS signal from a nearby ship but have a deadline to keep, what will you do? Your ship is completely customisable down to the tiniest component of each module. If your battery dies, it’s your own fault. You decided to go with a cheap Ventarii battery in the first place, and it was out of your stubbornness that you bought a Connext Hap Node when the mechanic recommended a Xiao Sa brand model. Silly you. You can play it safe in the central systems or design your ship with the ability to outrun, outfight or out-hide your opponents and make your fortune in the outer rims. But be careful! You are just as easily prey as predator in deep space… Features List: Massive open world to explore full of NPCs to interact with Complex contract-based economic system with over 50 employers Time-based open world - opportunities, stories and events happen at certain times as well as certain places, so each play through will be different Tense submarine-influenced combat Fully customisable ships - design your vessel for combat, shipping, stealth and more Mostly avoidable combat for more pacifistic players A world of side quests - no single linear story players are required to follow Explore 12 hand-crafted populated star and 20 uncharted systems full of unknown threats and treasures Find derelict ships, wreckages, cargo pods and communication beacons adrift in space Be a trader, bounty hunter, explorer, pirate or all of them at the same time Sandbox mode - play the game without narrative content in an endless version of the game Scenarios - tense combat scenarios task the player with overcoming impossible odds and testing their skill Multi-player Scenarios - compete or cooperate in a variety of multiplayer modes and situations Build your own DIY controllers at home using Arduinos - anyone can construct their own ship bridge with physical switches and buttons with just a little bit of soldering know-how.

In our version of history, nations clash for global dominance. The continent is an epic battlefield, so you’ll have to build cities, recruit troops, study new technologies and wipe out your opponents. Your nation needs a proper commander! New Medieval warfare Tactics are essential in Taste of Power. The numbers of your enemies' troops don't mean much if you meet them with a proper artillery battery. Engineering power has no limits here, as you can build mobile defenses to protect strategic positions. Build underground tunnels to move your forces across the battle lines faster and surprise your opponent! Each nation has a unique set of units. Taste of Power offers a drastically different style of play for each faction. European troops European knights can form different defensive formations, like Phalanx or spear walls. Having troubles in battle? Summon the Crusaders and crush your enemies! Having issues with your army's discipline and morale? Command your monks to encourage your army with the Word of God. You can also use gunpowder and make a difference that way. It's up to you what call to make! Middle Eastern warriors Great warriors, Timurids, can use elephants to help their cause. Command one to crash those around, or get help from chariots with incendiary oils to burn your enemies down. Their engineers are masters of the earth digging techniques – a stealth attack through an underground tunnel will surely be lethal. Yet again, shot-calling is essential and key in the game. Chinese heroes Unlike the Europeans and Timurids, the Chinese have other ways of using gunpowder. Use smokescreens to protect your army from arrows, throw poison grenades and burst low-tech missiles – make the battlefield a living hell for your enemies! After that, you can call for your cavalrymen to end their suffering. You can also set traps for the enemy and medical tents for yourself. The economy of the game is similar to strategy masterpieces.

Or at least…she thinks she is. In truth, she can’t remember much about herself at all. She didn’t even remember her name until she saw it on her patient record. See, she just found herself waking from a coma, alone and in the dark, strapped to an operating table in a hospital called “Amare Patriarcha Crucis.” The hospital has been ransacked, by the looks of it – papers strewn everywhere, gurneys and boxes piled up in the halls, and not a soul in sight. And the outside exits are all either locked up tight or sealed off with steel shutters. She is completely alone and trapped…at first. It’s not long before she discovers that there are others in the hospital with her, however. Some are friends, trapped here just as Ayame has been. Others are foes: the ones who trapped her here, and who now appear to mean her physical harm. And still others are savage, inhuman monstrosities that shouldn’t even exist in this world. Ayame must now piece together the mystery of what happened in Amare Patriarcha Crucis, how she came to be lying comatose within its walls, and perhaps most importantly…how to escape with her life.

As the daughter of an illustrious woman, Mikoto is expected to train hard, and one day take her mother’s place – but there’s a catch. Mikoto is a complete failure of a foxgirl! Despite being twenty-five years of age, Mikoto only has one tail. She fumbles even the simplest of spells, and her hand-to-hand combat skills are laughable. She routinely loses mock battles against her tutor, Ohana, and the other foxgirls in her clan shun and mock her owing to her ineptitude. Unsatisfied with her mundane life in Yamatai, Mikoto dreams of leaving home and speaking to the humans that live in the nearby Warren Village. Mikoto has heard humans are wicked and untrustworthy, but Mikoto is an optimist at heart, and she’s sure humans can’t be as bad as the stories say. And so, on one dark night, Mikoto runs away from her home to attend the annual harvest festival in Warren Village. There, she meets a beautiful knight called Juni, and she is irrevocably drawn to her. An intense, passionate relationship soon blossoms between the pair… But foxgirls like Mikoto aren’t welcome among humans, and Ohana is determined to get her runaway pupil back, no matter the cost. Can Mikoto and Juni’s love work out, or is it doomed to failure? That depends on you! Mikoto is a cheerful, outgoing foxgirl with a zest for life.

She’s pushy and insistent, and perhaps her advances are a tad inappropriate… but she’s pure at heart, and apologizes whenever she goes too far. Ohana is Mikoto’s tutor. She’s a forest nymph who’s lived for several centuries, and she possesses immense magical power that rivals even that of Mikoto’s mother, Himiko. Ohana is a stern woman, and she takes her duties as Mikoto’s tutor very seriously. She’s the first to rebuke Mikoto whenever she makes a mistake – but she loves her charge a great deal, and wants only the best for her. Juni is a softly-spoken human who lives in Warren Village. She served in the army for several years, and her skills with a sword are impeccable. Though Juni often wears armor and wields a blade, she’s a kind soul and generous soul who can’t bear to see people in need.

This powerful software guides you through the process from beginning to end, giving you practical and legal information to make the best decisions for you and your family. Quicken WillMaker &amp; Living Trust is the original will-writing software, created and updated regularly by Nolo’s experts. Make living trusts to spare your family the hassle and expense of probate. WillMaker also includes health care directive, durable power of attorney, final arrangements, letters to survivors and much more. Will-Writing Software The heart of every estate plan is a will, also known as a last will and testament. This legal document puts you in control of who inherits your property and who would take care of your children if it were ever necessary. Without a will, state law determines these issues.* Making a will rarely involves complicated legal rules. If you’re like most people, you won’t need a lawyer. With good do-it-yourself materials, it’s not difficult to make a will that takes care of basic concerns, such as leaving a home, investments, a small business, and personal items to your loved ones. With Quicken WillMaker &amp; Trust 2020 you can: Revise and update your will at any time Appoint guardians for your children and pets Name an executor (or ‘personal representative’) to carry out your wishes Appoint a trusted person to manage property left to young people How Do Living Trusts Avoid Probate? For many Americans, a significant goal of estate planning is to avoid probate. A revocable living trust, unlike a will, offers a fast, private, probate-free way to transfer one’s property after death. Although a living trust is not a complete substitute for a will (it doesn’t allow you to name a guardian for a child, for example), it is definitely a more efficient way to transfer property at death, especially large-ticket items such as a house. A Living Trust will ensure that your property bypasses lengthy and expensive probate proceedings. A living trust is about as easy to prepare as a will. Do-it-yourself and save hundreds of dollars on attorney fees. Durable Power of Attorney A durable power of attorney ensures that someone you trust (called your “agent” or “attorney-in-fact”) will be on hand to manage the many practical, financial tasks that will arise if you become incapacitated. For example, bills must be paid, bank deposits must be made, and someone must handle insurance and benefits paperwork. In most cases, a durable power of attorney for finances is the best way to take care of tasks like these. You can also give your attorney-in-fact authority over your digital assets. Health Care Directive or Living Will Spare your loved one’s difficult decisions by laying out your wishes for medical care and naming someone to carry out your instructions. Includes a health care power of attorney and a living will. Final Arrangements Plan a funeral or other ceremony and ease the burden on your loved ones. Describe your preferences for burial, cremation, memorials, obituaries and more. Letters to Survivors Use the Letter to Survivors to leave your loved ones detailed explanations about your decisions. For example, you may want to let them know why you made certain gifts or named a person to be your executor. You can also use your letter to leave some general thoughts about your life. *Documents reflect the laws of your state – estate planning documents are not valid in Canada, Louisiana and US Territories",3,269.97,3,1498,0,True,2019

You’ll spend most of your time training and equipping your companions to become an unstoppable force on the battlefield, ready to take on wild beasts just as well as war parties. We’ve come up with this idea back in 2009, and throughout many iterations and attempts it’s flourished into what it is currently. Keep in mind that the current version is still far from our goal and the game is under heavy development as you can see in our news section. The Valrenay were the last to join the war that’s been consuming the islands for centuries. Up until recently they only kept to themselves, developing their technology in peace. Now they’re fighting for their piece of the cake, fielding troops equipped with firearms and steam-powered body enhancements. Scarres were getting the short end of the stick for quite some time, until the new generation of Shamans was born. Under their leadership they began to take back lands that were once theirs. Scarres control the dangerous Blood Magics to wreck havoc on the battlefield. Their units get more powerful as their allies get withered or die near them due to their unique faction rule called ' Vengeance '. Custom and gritty combat system: no one is invincible as a single well-aimed strike can take out a careless warrior. No battle is truly over until it’s over: eliminate the enemy captain to win the battle, but be careful as it works the other way around too! Tried and proven formula: the world of Navaroth has its roots in an original pen-and-paper RPG system featuring a science based magic system. Pick your side: become an ally to the vengeful Scarres or join the ranks of the wise Valrenay militia. More factions will be revealed during the development. Take care of your men: keep their morale high by serving them luxury food and alcohol, train them at special facilities when they gather enough experience and crucially - don’t let them bleed out after a tough battle. No two soldiers are ever the same: play to your units natural predispositions, train and equip them to your liking. New world on each playthrough: the continent and its political climate are procedurally generated at the beginning of every journey. We've recently released a pretty big update that added Fog of War to battles and addressed a lot of core gameplay, balance and progression issues. You can read more on that in our Announcements section. We’re a small indie developer from Poland and we’re working hard to realize our dream project. We specialize in mechanics-heavy games for the PC, we only work on games that we want to play ourselves, and we’re all PC gamers at heart. With Glorious Companions we’re inspired by both video game classics such as Mount &amp; Blade and Heroes of Might and Magic series, but also by an array of miniature wargames and pen-and-paper RPGs that we love to play in our free time.",103,2058.97,29,1671,0,True,2019

However, it is impossible to make out what the person is saying. The most mysterious thing, though, is related to the fact that according to the maps the place the signal is coming from does not exist. As a main character, you will have to uncover terrifying secrets about this enigmatic signal. There is no weapon in the game. The protagonist does not know how to handle it. The most useful thing you have is a radio. With its help you can understand what is happening in this place. You choose the radio wave on your own in order to catch the desired signal, contact people, or simply listen to the radio of the USSR. There are a lot of moments in the game related to the use of the radio. The story in Noise is not a typical faceless horror. We'd like to tell you an interesting yet sinister story in Stephen King's manner. The story will be rendered through conversations and thoughts of the protagonist as well as through the study of locations. Some details of the story can remain unnoticed if you don't study the locations carefully. The story is set in the USSR which gives it a peculiar flair. The main antagonist of the story is the creature which is constantly wandering around, exploring the location the same way you do. It hunts you and reacts to your actions. If you turn on the light or use a flashlight, the creature will go and check what is happening. You need to try hard to hide from it because you cannot kill it. The creature sees nothing in the dark, so sometimes it will be enough to simply turn off the light and wait for a while. The creature emits radio waves, so you can track it with your radio. We tried to implement the artificial intelligence system in the game, being inspired by the monster from the Alien film and game. The creature is important to the story.

There's a main story about what this power does to her. The procedure leads to 10 different endings. The story proceeds through prostitution and fighting at the player's discretion. Which ending is the official history of Tanya? This judgment should be left to the player's judgment. *Recommended a person who wants to fight (Adoption of Sexual Harassment Dispatch Battle) a person who loves sexual harassment and prostitution (Let's earn money through sexual harassment and prostitution in the city.) Pregnant women (If it comes out, you may be pregnant, but it can be prevented with a female condom.) *Battle The battle scene uses a side view. Enemy characters are divided into monsters and human types, and monsters only have sexual harassment. People tend to be sexually harassed and sexually assaulted. If you have sex, If you don't have a female condom, there is a possibility that you get pregnant. If you become pregnant, you will be restricted in your behavior, so let's give birth at a hospital. You need money when you give birth, but let's earn the cost of giving birth through prostitution. *Defeat Monsters and human enemies each have a defeat scene. If you lose, your money goes down and you're just put back home, so let's fight hard. *You don't have to lose on purpose because the losing scene is the game clear, the main part and the reminiscence scene are released. *Sexual harassment Sexual harassment occurs when you come into contact with your uncle. There are 10 kinds of sexual harassment, and you can find it by looking around the city. There are no restrictions on this, so you can be sexually harassed right after the game starts. *Prostitution Prostitution is the act of performing an event, which leads to sexual desire and the appearance of an uncle in the city, so people call out to prostitute themselves. There are 13 kinds of prostitution. I think sexual harassment and prostitution can release all events relatively easily. When the values such as the degree of sexual intercourse and acts in the chest increase, the gasping voice and expression change. Sexual harassment and prostitution can be practiced by ordinary people, so I often work as prostitute and save money. Get ready and go on a quest. *Costume When it comes to prostitution and sexual harassment, the clothes you wear are reflected. You will be able to have sexual harassment and prostitution in a new mood by buying costumes. *Ending There are 10 kinds of endings. You have a choice just before the end. *25 basic CG images (There are many differences due to changes in facial expressions and costumes.) *Manuals and strategies are included in the game folder.",1,13.99,0,1579,0,True,2019

Thrust into unfortunate circumstances, you find yourself with no other option than to unravel what might be your biggest case yet. There is no choice. We change, but we change nothing. Get to work, detective. Backbone: Prologue is the first act of a post-noir narrative adventure. Become raccoon private eye Howard Lotor and explore dystopian Vancouver inhabited by animals as you uncover a deeply personal story of change and transformation. Backbone is inspired by film noir, weird sci-fi, post-soviet aesthetics, modern political regimes, the works of Lynch and Kaufman, and existential philosophy of Sartre. It is a linear, cinematic narrative experience that subverts genre and challenges your perception of what it means to be a person. Backbone’s gameplay is focused on storytelling and emotional expression, featuring rich and elaborate dialogues inspired by old school CRPGs, as well as exploration of the lush environments. The end of all things is inevitable, but defining which version of Howard Lotor reaches the conclusion is up to you. As Howard, you will: • Make meaningful connections with a diverse cast of characters in pursuit of truth • Shape and express your identity through dialogue choices - decide what kind of person you want to be • Explore and experience both downtrodden and flourishing districts of a strange, yet familiar version of Vancouver • Come to terms with the universal pain of existence and loss • Be a raccoon Post-noir dystopia Backbone’s Vancouver is a dangerous place, bleak and dreary, but not entirely without hope.

Explore Earth and our neighboring worlds in the Solar System, orbit a black hole in a galaxy billions of light-years away, or visit anything in between seamlessly, with no transitions. All of time and space are yours to explore – cruise between the stars at a million times the speed of light, and accelerate time to watch the orbital motions of a thousand worlds play out before your eyes. Every planet you encounter in your journey will feature procedural 3D terrain with detailed textures. Everything you see in the sky – stars and galaxies, planets and moons, asteroids and comets, black holes and neutron stars, star clusters and nebulae – are yours to explore at the press of a button. Spacecraft with Newtonian physics and pilot-assist autopilot features (in early development but fully usable) are yours to fly anywhere in the universe in the Flight Simulator mode. SpaceEngine is also very friendly for creators of mods and add-ons – create your own planets, star systems, even galaxies, import your own spacecraft models, create custom GUI skins, and more, all easily sharable with others. With SpaceEngine, the possibilities are limitless. SpaceEngine Planetarium capabilities: Astronomy All types of celestial objects are represented: galaxies, nebulae, stars and star clusters, planets and moons, comets and asteroids. Known celestial objects are represented using data from catalogs: galaxies (NGC/IC), stars (HIPPARCOS), star clusters, nebulae, and planets (Solar System and known extrasolar planets). Regions of space not yet cataloged feature procedurally generated objects: galaxies, stars, star clusters, nebulae, and planetary systems. Controls You are free to move around the universe – travel seamlessly between any object and any distance, from surface to orbit to interstellar and intergalactic space. Moving through space is as easy as 'click and go', as well as game-style free flight using the WASD keys or a gamepad. Also, time travel is possible: you can accelerate, decelerate, or reverse the flow of time, and jump to a specified date. Detailed interactive tutorials will familiarize you with the controls. Graphics Volumetric 3D models of galaxies and nebulae with interstellar dust clouds, and 3D landscapes on planets and stars. For many Solar System bodies, actual data from space probes is used, with huge, high-resolution texture packs available as free DLC. For unmapped and procedural planets, the surface is generated procedurally using your computer's GPU. Other features include realistic atmospheric scattering, eclipse shadows, animated auroras and comet tails, and physically-based light warping near black holes and neutron stars, with animated accretion disks and jets. Physics Realistic and physically-based generation of procedural objects (galaxies, star systems, planets) and their physical properties (mass, radius, temperature, atmospheric parameters, etc). The orbital motion of planets, moons, and stars in multiple-star systems are accurately calculated and displayed. Realistic space ship design concepts and physics: orbital motion, atmospheric flight model, and Alcubierre warp drive physics. Virtual reality SpaceEngine supports Oculus (via native library) and SteamVR (HTC Vive, Valve Index, WMR and other headsets). Support of VR controllers is partial: you can select objects with one controller and move around with the other one. Please note that VR support is still a work in progress, and new users should become familiar with the program in 2D before trying to use VR. Sound Original background music tracks made by many authors, with context-sensitive playback. Sound effects for planetary environments and space ships are in development. Tools Built-in tutorials will help you start using the Planetarium. Search for celestial objects by name and search for the nearest star systems. Browse the cosmos using a scalable Universe map and planetary system chart. Saving, exporting, and importing of locations is supported, which can easily be shared between users. The program keeps an automatic journal of objects you have recently visited. Learn every detail about the objects you find using the built-in “Wiki” info system, with additional hand-written descriptions of many known objects. Display the orbital paths of celestial objects, labels and markers, constellations, and other informational tools. Multi-language support Currently SpaceEngine is available in English, German, French, Italian, Spanish, Dutch, Finnish, Swedish, Croatian, Czech, Polish, Ukrainian, Russian, Catalan, Chinese, Japanese, Korean languages. Many new localizations are under development. Only localizations which are 100% complete are displayed on the Steam store page, but you can enable others in-game. Modding SpaceEngine supports creating and importing user add-ons: catalogs, models and textures for deep space objects, planets, and space ships. Spacecraft models, representing both real and fictional designs – including from popular sci-fi franchises – are commonly imported and shared by the community on the Steam Workshop.",6456,161335.44,5867,1664,12,True,2019

Dash, shoot, and teleport around unique arenas that feature impossible geometry where there is no right side up and death can come from any direction. You’d better bring your A game and telefrag your enemies into oblivion if you want to excel in PvP duels. Set in an alternative universe where the Roman Empire never collapsed, you step into the shoes of a new breed of a gladiator on the road to becoming a champion. Use your speed, accuracy, and wits to outmaneuver and defeat your enemies, crushing them beneath your feet. Loadout Management – Pick your favorite loadout to outwit your enemy. Combine powerful firearms to create the most powerful set. Each weapon features two firing modes and a unique teleportation attack. Teleport Attacks and Telefrags – Use teleport to move through the play space or telefrag your enemy! See them reduced to a pulp, using the well-known ability. Guns – Pick the best one, including classic arena shooter weapons, such as Rocket Launchers and Flak Cannons, as well as futuristic Plasma Rifles. Fast-Paced Matches – You have two different locomotion types at your disposal. Get comfortable with dash movement or experience, why gladiatorial battles are reserved for the most persistent ones in the free locomotion. Impossible spaces – Fight in unique arenas arranged with no regard for gravity, opening up various angles of attack and movement. The designed maps will force you to be on guard. Arena Game Mode – Fight in 1v1 deathmatches on the principle of rounds. Climb up the leaderboards and conquer the most significant win streak. The Empire has never forgotten about their beliefs and traditions, including gladiatorial battles, which have now become the most prestigious sport in the sprawling intergalactic Empire. You can play 1v1 deathmatches in a best-of-five rounds format to determine the ultimate victor . As for futuristic gladiators, there is no place for losers. Wager your hard-earned loadouts and try to stay alive for as many matches as possible to make your mark in the global leaderboards. PvP matches will require a good knowledge of the arenas in addition to creative use of dashes and teleports to gain the upper hand in combat. But these abilities are for more than just defense and evasion – after all, the game is called Telefrag . Tired of shooting or in the middle of reloading? No problem, teleport through your enemies to watch as they’re reduced to a pulp. The game’s abstract arenas will test your skills. Move dynamically through the designed maps and don't stay in one place under any circumstances. Shoot your opponents with a range of firearms, from the staples of the genre to new, unique entries. But if you’re going to outwit your enemies, you’ll need to choose your loadouts carefully! Some may work better against your opponent than others. Each weapon also has a unique, built-in teleportation attack that is more than just a means of locomotion. Prove that in this prestigious sport you have something to say.

This means they pass on their characteristics to their offspring and accidental mutations can occur. You can, of course, actively control the development of your meadow by removing specific modifications from certain flowers and using them for other flowers. Simple modifications support the flowers in many ways. Complex modifications either positively or negatively interact with the flowers around them. There are 27 simple and 27 complex modifications; you can incorporate two of each of type of modification into a flower. This is equivalent to more than 120,000 possible combinations per flower! You can either simply observe the meadow or actively intervene. Each time, different flowers will dominate the meadow. If, during the course of the game, flowers appear that are better adapted to their environment, different flowers might start to dominate. This means that each meadow evolves in a different way. To find out if flowers are successful, you can call on enemy aliens and use them to test your meadow’s viability. The simulation game can be played with up to four players at a time. Players can either evolve the meadow together or defend the meadow against strange aliens. You can also fight each other directly. When you play together, resources will soon become scarce. You can only use modifications that have evolved on the meadow. Features: The nature like evolution system ensures that every meadow develops slightly different. Elaborated nature simulation where everything influences the meadow, the immediate surroundings, the daytime and the weather. Lifetime, petal color and cost for seed are almost continuously variable. Together with the different numbers of petals, they produce countless property combinations for each flower.

The world has also been seeing more riots than ever due to food shortage problems. Endless wars over borders wrought chaos on Earth. IDUNN Co. , a global high-tech corporation, promoted a power generation project in which small planets would supply energy for the world. The company then planned to create , a facility similar to Noah’s Ark where everything that humans need to live—water, food, energy, etc. —will be supplied from the small planets for self-sufficiency. This plan saw gigantic investments from various countries such as the United States and China. After fierce competition, the first group of residents was selected. Through IDUNN Bay, IDUNN Co. seemed to be searching for Planet Goldilocks,a planet that could support life, and planning relocation to another galaxy. In reality, however, the company was planning to build a military hub on another planet to conquer and colonize other planets. Odin, the head of IDUNN Co.’s research center and source of the latest cutting-edge technology, found 5 small planets in the Bairan Galaxy that could supply 5 different energy sources—earth, water, wind, fire, and nuclear fusion. And so, he successfully developed a new system for IDUNN Bay to use these forms of energy. It was an energy revolution, and the first time that energy was supplied from outer space. The Bairan Galaxy, however, was the main playground of the “Undying,” space pirates that invade and plunder small planets and attack and pillage probes passing by. To the Undying, the Earthlings had come out of nowhere and just started harvesting energy. “Beast,” commander of the Undying, believed that the Earthlings posed an obstacle to the Undying, and so he declared war on IDUNN Bay. To prepare for the upcoming war, Beast helped some of his most trusted men from Planet Nass, a jail for nefarious criminals. Knowing that they were at a disadvantage in this war against the Undying, IDUNN Bay posted billboards throughout Bairan Galaxy to recruit mercenaries. An exorbitant reward was offered for the head of Beast, the greatest threat of the Bairan Galaxy.

Players with less violent intent can find secret paths to complete Mable without killing anything, including bosses. Unlike most Metroidvanias Mable does not allow you to run, jump and kill on your own. Instead, you must use non-human forms to attack creatures and traverse through difficult challenges. The strange cult that resurrected you speak of an ancient prophecy that says you will hunt down the great beasts, take their shape, and use their powers to save this dying world. But what if they're wrong? The prophecy is old, and words lose their meaning with time... When the world is falling apart around you, what will you do? In Mable &amp; The Wood, it's up to you to make that choice. You don't have to kill anyone, but you might kill everyone. Will you banish the darkness, or will you become it?

Recall the sword to your hand once again to slice through any enemies in your path. You can only maintain your non-human form for a limited time, but killing creatures extends your power.

There WILL be updates on this game, timescales though I cannot give. I hope you can enjoy it for what it is. Thank you. 'The End of an Age: Fading Remnants' is a story-driven RPG game for PC and is a Single-player experience. It is the first in the 'The End of an Age' Trilogy. The game is being developed to fill the huge void left behind by one of RPG's greatest sons, designed to be reminiscent of the earlier Final Fantasys' with a focus on character development and an enriching story. Whilst it is a small-budget game, I am doing my best to make the game as good as possible with the funds and resources I have available. The game is being produced with RPGMakerVX Ace as this is a platform which I am able to utilise and is fitting with the JRPG Genre as well as art style. Of course, many aspects of RPGMaker can be customised with the use of scripts and imported graphics and art, which will be revealed and put in place during development. A few of the key features: *Between 40-60 hours of gameplay. *Turn-based ATB battle system with random encounters. *Many dungeons to explore. And Puzzles to solve. *An engrossing story of betrayal and honour. *In game battle arena to earn big rewards! The story takes place in a fantasy world with a mysterious great evil threatening to destroy mankind and all that it has touched. 'Fading Remnants' focuses on the character of 'Wilfred', the son of a famous knight who was driven to madness during his many years of battles. He eventually died, while still claiming 'a great evil from another world would destroy all'. It begins as the King's castle is attacked by the Empire and their Skeleton horde, and Wilfred must return and save his king and kingdom from destruction.

Use your bombs as a handy weight. Create a barricade and shield enemy attacks. Dig and destroy to uncover secret areas. Set things on fire and watch them BURN! Blue Fried Chicken The BFC Company established itself as the leader of the cooked poultry market after the introduction of its famous blue hot sauce in the mid 1980’s. Not much is known about what exactly is in the sauce or what makes it so addictive. Rumour says it is collected rather than made from within a temple that BFC purchased under dubious circumstances. The temple and the Blue Hot Sauce are regarded with such significance that BFC made the temple their official HQ. Security is tight at the facility and they only employ the local jungle inhabitants to work there for fear of the secrets getting into the hands of rival fast food chains. Unconfirmed reports from workers speak of a legend written on the walls deep within the temple. It is said that tampering with the mysterious blue sauce will bring about a dreaded curse too terrible to imagine!",235,3522.65,200,1720,10,True,2019

Can you time your cannon fire perfectly to defeat your opponent? In Pond Wars two players sit down on a single keyboard. Each player controls a boat, which they can move left and right on a 2D screen. Each boat is equipped with a cannon that is used to fire shots at the opponent ship. Hit your opponent's boat enough times, and their boat will sink to the bottom of the pond, giving you the victory. Sounds simple right? The trick is you can't aim your shots directly. Each time a cannon ball hits the water, it will create waves. You have to time your shot perfectly with the bouncing waves in order to hit your opponent. As more cannon balls hit the water, the waves become bigger and bigger, allowing for all sorts of mayhem. Games are quick matches that last five or so minutes each. Of course if you win, your opponent is going to want to get revenge in a rematch. Note this game plays with two players on one keyboard. No single player is available. Features: - Two player game play - Configurable keyboard controls - Physics based wave system - Fun and mayhem",1,4.99,1,1658,0,True,2019

The development of Rocketboarder originally started way back in 2016. I had the objective of making a flying game, but when I tested some free-flying game mechanics, I felt some motion sickness! So, rather than making a game where the player can freely fly and turn and spin, I chose to pursue a game where the player is constantly advancing forward. This makes Rocketboarder, in some strange way, a VR descendant of classic space shooters . Steer the board with your body To play Rocketboarder, you plant your feet in a wide stance and calibrate the center of your head. Lean left and the board drifts left, lean right and the board drifts right. Crouch downward and your board swoops down; stand up with your hands to the sky to fly upward. Body Avatar even with no Trackers Since the player is supposed to play with their feet planted, the in-game foot location combined with the tracked location of the head and controllers can be used to position a virtual avatar. It's not perfect but it should give a cool effect! (Turn the body on in the Game Options menu) Despite not requiring body-trackers for body presence, you CAN use 2 or 3 Vive Trackers to enhance the body tracking . DIY Motion Rig if you dare? Have you ever wanted to have your own motion rig? Do you have a Vive Tracker that you don't know what to do with? Make yourself a DIY balance board to control the game! But you absolutely should have a friend there to catch you if you try that! (Note that this might not work simultaneously with the body trackers) More info soon. Follow-up to The Path of Greatest Resistance The Machine Alliance is has returned! This game is a follow-up to The Path of Greatest Resistance, (but no need to play that game before you play this one.)

Mankind unleashed a darkness upon the land and therefore themselves. Those in power far from the front-line, refuse to acknowledge the darkness of this plague as nothing more than a disease that could be contained and resolved, to maintain order and control of their kingdom, and the people within it. During this time of despair, unrest, and fear,... the common peasants would find solace in a pursuit of the dark arts, for being feared by your subjugator releases one from being their subject. A cabal formed spreading rumors of how powerful they were, when in fact they knew nothing but parlor trickery. However, this inspired many and from that arose the pursuit of real magic. Many believed the pinnacle of which to be the art of evocation. Summoning entities for one's self, to guide, protect, and otherwise control. Few who practiced saw results, but some did. Three Magi combined their efforts, in an attempt to gain dominion over the most powerful entity of the spirit world. Over time they were coerced by a voice that whispered through the ether, speaking of great power simply by opening a gateway to the world of the entity, and walking through it. By embracing the unique energy of this realm that exists beyond the veil would have them return as the most powerful sorcerers in their land. Enticed, the Magi were guided by the voice through the incantation, indeed opening a gateway. From the gate, a sudden barrage of growling turned to screaming poured out with a dark fog crawling across the floor. Their desire for power and foolishness became immediately clear. Tearing through the flesh-like fabric of the gate, coalesced the beast with which they were speaking. As if born anew into this physical form, and experiencing hunger for the first time, the beast devoured the Magi leaving only scraps of flesh and bone behind. And it is with this mortal shell, that the beast would travel consuming all in its wake and opening more gates along its path. Tearing through the veil that once protected mankind from the chaos of this dark realm,... now came forth a throng of evil. The darkness that trickles from these gates brings with it a pestilence that kills all vegetation, causes animals to become rabid attacking without provocation, and men who stood against it would be driven insane, should they survive. Those that escaped its slow grasp of death, spoke of a dark fog that lay low to the ground that could be seen on the horizon prior to the plague consuming their village. Which lead to the understanding that there is safety in higher elevations however, few places are safe from these demonic beings embedded with violence that spill from the now torn veil. Absorbing into all things, the essence of this plague does in fact contain the power that the Magi sought, which can be extracted neutralized and used to infuse items with great power, to fight the darkness itself. Reign hearkens back to when players had to play a game to figure things out with a short learning curve. Reign does not attempt to repeat the common theme of this genre, there are enough clones already. So expect things to work a bit differently. Although Reign has only 1 developer, check back every week because things are always being added/updated and that is likely to become more frequent after release. The product will become more refined in all areas, including more Terrain(explore-able world), more skills, skins, animations, creatures, bosses, events, features, etc. Reign of Darkness is a PC based Apocalyptic, Medieval Online RPG which will offer some references to real historical subjects that are fictionalized for the players to experience. During Early Access players have the opportunity to take part in the experience of playing a game while it is still evolving and being created. Exploring new areas as development progresses and also having their voice and opinions heard on topics relating to the game. Reign strives to eventually become an MMO (massive multiplayer online) RPG however, the massive part can't simply be programmed. We will need a community to achieve that feat. -Players will find randomly generated unique items which can also be modified to suit their specific needs(strength, intellect, etc). If a player finds an item that has an appearance they prefer over their current item they are using, the stats of items can be transferred (with the right reagents), giving the player the appearance they most prefer. -Players start with 10 skill points and can choose from a variety of skills. Each level up grants 2 skill points which players can use to learn a new skill or increase the rank of a known one. In addition 10 attribute points are gained per level up for players to allocate how they prefer (ex: Strength, Intellect, etc). Skill points can be allocated across three out of 8 'classes' allowing many possible combinations and extensive build customization. -Players can also, hire and assign equipment to Mercenaries that will assist them in instanced enviroments, which allows for dynamic experiences with or without friends. -One can steal a dragon egg to be hatched, raised, and summoned for the use of transportation. -Fight against giant beasts, demons, monsters that are controlled by Game Masters, not having a predictable AI system for rare events, creates a dynamic challenge. Players must combine forces and create strategies to defeat such enemies when and where they may occur. -More Races (a different kind of Orc is in progress) -More Armor options (skins) -More Mounts -More Areas to explore -Pets (some may have passive benefits such as additional inventory space) -Better Graphics and Visual Effects -Some gear will offer set bonuses based on the name of the armor set and how many pieces you have equipped -Reign will dive into origins of Mythological creatures, and tie them to the Medieval Age. Creatures such as Werewolves, Minotaurs, Gorgons(Medusa), Hell, and the devil as an opposing forces. Vampires such as the story and origin of Dracula, 'Vlad the Impaler' or, Vlad Tempest. Who's father Dracul(meaning Dragon) formed 'The Order of the Dragon'. Which Dracula(meaning 'Son of the Dragon') would inherit. Players will engage in a story line that revolves around 'The Order of the Dragon' (eventually as a faction) and can obtain Vampiric abilities/properties themselves. ________________________________________________________________________________ ________________________________________________________________________________ Follow development on Trello here: -of-darkness Powered by SmartFoxServer",277,5537.23,155,1502,0,True,2019

31579,ManGuin – Penguin Apocalypse,2019-12-11,2.99,0,Gary & Eddy,EGCL,"Indie,Strategy","What's It About! It's a real-time strategy (RTS) game which comes from our love of 50s Sci-fi films. Set in Antarctica you control a team of top scientists researching penguins. Disaster strikes when a satellite carrying an unknown space virus crashes near a penguin colony. The infected penguins quickly mutate and start attacking and infecting anything near them! Armed with tranquilliser guns your team must develop the cure and heal the penguins before the virus jumps species and infects the whole of the human race. Game Play You control your team of scientists and soldiers (10 maximum) using standard RTS commands. The view is isometric. You have to use your powers of deduction to find the cure – you select what cure you are going to try, load up the cure into your tranquilser darts and send your team out. Your team of expert scientists will examine the data and get the results back. You can then adjust the formula and try again until you find the cure. You start off with a small team but can call on help which will be delivered by helicopter from an off-shore vessel. Protect your generator - if it gets attacked power stops being provided and your base will start to shut down! If your island gets overrun - there will be four other islands for you to protect. Fail all five and the virus wins! Your Mission You head up a top secret research team consisting of scientists and soldiers at a remote base on a small island in the Antarctic. You and several colonies of penguins are the only inhabitants until the incident occurs! Your Team Your team is made up of Scientists (yellow jackets) and Soldiers (red jackets). Scientists are obviously the people to do the research in the lab but they are also great at mending the generator and treating the wounded in the hospital. Conditions are harsh and dangerous so highly trained soldiers are available. They move faster than Scientists and are much better shots with the dart rifle that everyone carries. Your Base The base has a collection of buildings located near the middle of the island. There are four small huts used for observation spread around the island. The Lab - this is where you research a cure for the virus. The more people in the lab the faster the results will come through. Click on the RED GREEN and BLUE parts to create a vaccine. Whenever someone leave the lab their dart rifle will be loaded with that formula. The Main Hut - The warmest building on the base. People come here to rest and most importantly get warm! Radio Station - From here you can order from your support ship extra scientists, soldiers and fuel. The station needs to be manned to work. You can also ask the helicopter to track down the nearest infected penguin. Hospital - Send your injured people here and they will be fixed up by the other people there. Scientists heal people better than soldiers. Radar Tower - While operational the radar tower will generate a radar map showing the location of your units, the helicopter and what part of the map you are looking at (yellow square indicates the camera's position). Landing Pad - This is where the helicopter delivers your units and fuel from the support ship. Note the helicopter pilot is under strict orders not to land and to turn back if there are any infected penguins near the pad. Generator - The generator uses the fuel to power the base. You can switch off the power to unused buildings to save fuel. If the generator gets attacked it will eventually fail. This means things will stop working - including the radar and keeping the huts warm! Scientists are the fastest at repairing damaged generators. Remote Huts - If while exploring the island your team needs refuge - these huts provide some warmth and protection. The Vaccine - Lab Results A vaccine consists of three values - codenamed RED, GREEN and BLUE. You have to figure out what sequence of the parts will cure the virus. For example a virus might be encoded BLUE RED BLUE - so attacking it with a GREEN BLUE RED vaccine will have no affect as the parts do not match. Whenever a dart hits an infected penguin the lab will start analysing the result (Eval will be displayed). How long it takes to complete the research depends on the number and composition of people in the lab. Scientists work much faster than soldiers. If the vaccine is not the cure you get told the number of parts correct. ONE means you have one of the parts correct. TWO, two of the parts correct. Using your powers of deduction you should be able to work out the cure! Your Aim! - Work out what the vaccine to the space virus is. - Administer it to the infected Penguins. - Be quick with your research as the virus can mutate - so all your research will have to be scrapped and you'll have to start again! - It's cold there so your team can't stay out there forever. You'll have to bring your team back to the huts to warm them up. - Make sure you do not run out of fuel - when needed you can request it from your support ship using the radio station. - Make sure your team does not get infected. ManGuin is the scientific term for whan a human becomes infected by the alien virus. The human will then attack non-infected humans. Game Controls - Select units by left clicking them with the mouse. - Right click on the terrain to move the selected units. - Right click on a building to move the unit into the building. - Left click on a building to see who is in there - and use the panel (bottom right) to get them to exit. - Move the view using WADS or arrow keys. F or R raises the camera. Q or E to rotate. C to revert to default view. - Main keyboard keys 0 to 9 select your unit. Shift to group select. - Numpad keys can also be used to move the view. - Left click on the radar panel to move the view to that part of the island. - Firing is automatic whenever an infected penguin is near. - To reload your tranquiliser gun visit the lab.

All the graphics and animations are handmade from plasticine. Beautiful soundtrack. Wurroom is an interactive art experience born in the minds of two holographic entities: Michael Rfdshir and Serge Bulat. You are just a cursor-Hand, lost in the undefined hyper wonderland, where visions, thoughts, and ideas from your subconscious, intermix with the fragments of 'other', inexperienced worlds. Wait... am I.. just a hand...??? Or am I the leading force behind all this, the one that could shake the core of this strange place?! Wurroom is an immersive experience into a surreal utopia, disguised as a short exploration adventure game. The hero is a mouse cursor; an ordinary Hand, becoming aware of its power over the strange Imaginarium. Wurroom is not just a game, it's an artistic collision between the minds of Michael Rifdshir and Serge Bulat; a metaphysical island created for the coexistence of ideas about art, nature, science, and Mind; all to question reality, and make a boundaryless new one. It is designed to reveal things about ourselves and measure our imagination. Everything you see in Wurroom is handmade; the claymated universe brought to live by stop-frame animation.
