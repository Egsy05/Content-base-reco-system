After charming the sweet-natured Astorian princess, Stephania, and her maid, the serious, no-nonsense Elizabeth, Hiroki takes the pair of them on a tour of Tokyo alongside Cosmos, the cheerful e-girl, and Ayu, the grumpy idol. With a gaggle of adoring girls in tow, Hiroki visits a maid café, drinks bubble tea, and goes on a trip to a theme park. His days with Stephania pass by in a blur, each one more exciting than the last… But there’s danger afoot, as Hiroki soon realizes there’s somebody watching him from the shadows: somebody who seems to have taken an unhealthy interest in him and his harem. Who is this mysterious stranger and what do they want? Hiroki is uncertain – but, if left unchecked, this person could cause chaos the likes of which Hiroki has never before known. Stephania is the princess of Astoria: a small European country situated near Germany. Stephania is adored by her doting parents who ensured, throughout her childhood, that she never wanted for anything. Raised in a palace and tended to by droves of servants, Stephania has it all… But, despite her august upbringing, Stephania grew up lonely, without many friends. After meeting Hiroki, she soon falls in love with him, and she quickly seizes on the opportunity to visit him in Japan. This is the first time Stephania has ever left her home country, and she’s incredibly excited by everything Japan has to offer. For Stephania, this really is the trip of a lifetime. Elizabeth is Stephania’s devoted maid who would do almost anything for her lady’s sake. Elizabeth takes her duties as a maid very seriously, and there’s nothing that brings her more joy than making Stephania happy. Elizabeth might act cool and serious, but she is fiercely protective of Stephania. If anything were to happen to her young mistress, her icy exterior would surely shatter, revealing just how passionate she can truly be. Cosmos Moretti is a half-Italian, half-Japanese succubus and a popular internet personality with millions of followers on RapidPound. Cosmos is renowned for taking photographs of herself wearing skimpy clothing, but Cosmos herself is rather naïve, and she doesn’t fully understand why her photos are considered so provocative. A daydreamy airhead who lives in cloud cuckoo land, Cosmos is a romantic at heart, and she fantasizes about one day marrying Hiroki. She is very open and earnest in her affections, which makes her perfect girlfriend material. Ikue Ayu is Japan’s top idol, and she’s also a succubus. Though Ayu acts cute and sweet while performing, she can be vicious about her fans when the cameras aren’t rolling. Ayu is a hard worker who’s prone to pushing herself to improve her craft, which further exacerbates her foul moods. It’s rare she gets any time off, and being under the spotlight 24/7 exhausts her. Ayu spends so much time publicly playing a character for the sake of her fans, she finds it hard to be honest with her true feelings in private. She often snaps at Hiroki, but deep down, she loves him dearly. Secretly, she wishes she could be more openly affectionate like Cosmos, but she’s too much of a tsundere. Maybe one day she’ll learn! Yue is the queen of the succubus realm and the power she wields is second to none. Yue might not be famous in the human world, unlike Cosmos and Ayu, but the respect her subjects bequeath her helps bolster her strength. Yue, much like Cosmos and Ayu, is head over heels for Hiroki, whom she knew before her ascension to the throne, back when she lived in the human realm. Yue has a short temper and she can be rather possessive, but she’s been working to change her ways. Displeased with how clingy she used to be, she’s trying earnestly to become more open to the idea of sharing Hiroki, hard though it might be.

Get through the missions given to you by Ramon Rodriguez and get to know many people as the story unfolds such as The Widow, Macaulay Fajny, Neil Muskett and JBJ. But there will also be people who will try to stop you. Mr. Flip has many reasons to keep the secrets of Haluwa buried deep for his personal financial gain or influence or both. Or does he? There will be many ways to overcome these troubles. You can go all in and buy N15 to steamroll through any shootout and make your way anywhere.

You can be garbage man or take P Car and deliver mail around Haluwa! You will learn names of roads and earn money this way and as a bonus you will know what it is like to be NPC! If you are not happy with your looks you can visit the barber or buy new clothes. You can also do this in Deadly Desire. Both will be visible on the map. As previously mentioned, there are guns. Gun control in Haluwa is non existent therefor you can buy gun as long as you have money to pay for it. One thing to keep in mind though is that you can not see how many bullets you have in your current magazine. Try to check them if you need to by holding your reload button. Or do not, you can see how many bullets you have in reserves together with your HP and armor and money when you press Z. At any other time, there is no HUD so that you can appreciate Haluwa in all its beauty. So there you go. But before you go and lose yourself in the music, the moment, Haluwa, you should know that there is no radar. Your map will not show where you are, just like in good old days. But do not worry. All the roads have their names registered on the map and sings are all around Haluwa to help you locate yourself, shall you need to. Others will tell you where to go, map will tell you how to get there and guns will get you through it. And of course...do not trust anyone because....What if they were right?",0,0.0,0,345,0,True,2023

Civilization was at the peak of its development, people conquered the solar system, colonizing its planets and satellites. But several large-scale man-made disasters and global wars in a row plunged the Earth into agony. Now the remnants of humanity are forced to lead a hard life on scraps of surviving land among the ruins of the old World. You are a lone wanderer walking through the endless wasteland. Your goal is vague, but your intentions are firm. You decide to challenge the cruel wasteland and go out on a dangerous road. Gameplay Apocalyptic Vibes is a single-player immersive first-person shooter with a non-linear narrative.

Machine guns, carbines, shotguns, rifles, etc. It remains only to get ammo and use the weapon for its intended purpose. Each weapon is specific and has its own tricks in handling. So, for example, by pressing a key, you can cock a revolver, shoot a double-shot with a shotgun, or use a bayonet. You are only a man, and your enemies are merciless, a few shots are enough for you to die. Only by learning to master your arsenal, you will be able to give a decent rebuff in a fight. Weather: Within each chapter, you can freely move between levels. You will unavoidably face the harsh postapocalyptic weather: toxic rain, storms, fogs and optical phenomena. You will be helped to survive by special equipment and the ability to use the little that wasteland gives. A hood will protect you from toxic rain, a gas mask will protect you from poisonous fog, and wayposts with a radio receiver will help you not to get lost and give you an opportunity to check the weather forecast in order to stock up on filters and necessary resources beforehand. It is also advisable that you always have a supply of provisions and medicines in your inventory. After all, health does not restore itself.

You cannot control other NPCs, however you can assign them jobs and give them orders and dress them however you want. You play the leader of a tribe and if they should die before naming an heir you can select an NPC to play. A year in game is about four hours of play time (subject to change) so you have plenty of time to develop your characters. As your legacy continues, you pass on traits through your genealogy and through training. In Legacy you live as the king or queen in your kingdom. You make the rules and you always have the final say. Exploration, city building, character development, combat and diplomacy how you play is how you build your legacy. In time as your kingdom grows you will discover fascinating places in your land. You can train your troops, outfit them it the best gear you have and set out for adventure with dreams of great spoils and better gear. Losing people in battle however, can have devastating consequences. A good soldier might take days to condition and train. Similar to other RPGs you need to make or loot better and better gear to take on bigger bosses. Some bosses require you to have help. So you will need to gear out your citizens and build an army. Although multiplayer is intended down the road, early on you'll be building raiding parties to lead into battle. This game is being made available in the pre-alpha stage for you who like the medieval city building genre so you can enjoy the game as it progresses at a lower price than the finished version. As the game develops past the initial release of version 1.0, updates will bring more expansions to the Legacy universe.

Some just want to survive off the land, others want to create amazing things. It’s up to you to use the extensive catalog of tools and buildings at your disposal to guide them towards their goals. Outlanders are individuals. Simple folk with hopes, dreams, and desires.  You cannot control them directly. Instead, you place buildings, manage resources and declare the number of work spots in each building, then watch the Outlanders themselves decide who takes which job, which house they inhabit, and which building to build. You can nudge them in the right direction by prioritizing certain tasks, or by passing Decrees™, which bend the rules of the game to allow things like longer work hours and tighter resource consumption. But beware… these often come at the expense of your follower’s happiness, so use them wisely. Unlike other games of its style, Outlanders’ campaign offers a string of increasingly complex mission-based levels, each with its own specific goals and story, where new buildings and mechanics are unlocked organically throughout. You will follow the story of a cast of lovable, eccentric, and (mostly) well-intentioned town leaders, as they pursue their dreams and whims, while their paths slowly start to intertwine in surprising, often humorous, sometimes heart-warming ways. When challenges get too hard and the Outlanders start getting too picky, you can take a detour to the Sandbox mode, where creativity is the new leader in town. You can play with the full catalog of buildings and mechanics right off the bat and customize the maps and rules as you please. Create themed towns, make up your own goals, or challenge yourself. You can create the experience of your choice, the only limit here is your imagination. There are no wars in the Outlands. No raids, no combat, no armed conflict of any kind. All the Outlanders coexist in harmony. It’s the choices you make that will lead you to either victory or failure. The many biomes and landscapes of the Outlands are rendered in a crisp and vibrant graphical style, dense with atmosphere and details that linger with you long after you put the game down. It all comes to life through rich sound design, full of authentic soundscapes unique to each biome, and underscored by an uplifting music soundtrack that brings the magic out of everyday labor in the Outlands. People have been visiting the Outlands for a while now, and have come together on Discord to form a very friendly and helpful community. Join our server and find helpful guides and tips, share your theories on the world of Outlanders and its many mysteries, participate in community challenges, or share a nice chat with friendly people.

Having been saved by this 'Napoleon' in the form of a girl, Shoichi ends up accompanying her on her quest. But in this world, not only is the past distorted, but the gods grant chosen girls the gift of greatness, who in turn fight one another using superhuman abilities known as 'Tenkei.' Will Shoichi be able to return to his own world? And what will become of his growing bond with Napoleon? Shoichi Sakikawa 'Just like that and I'm in another world? I don't know about this...'

During the game, both players will get an upgrade opportunity at intervals, a total of 15 times. You can choose to build a military base at a certain location for each upgrade. A military base is a unit that can create an army in the game besides the capital. Each type of base has 2 to 4 small divisions. These divisions are close to different intersections and exit points. Only when all the small divisions are occupied by the enemy, the base will surrender to the enemy. Under this setting of guarding a single entrance and exit, the internal divisions of the base There are also fences, the purpose of which is to prevent the attacker from easily infiltrating other partitions, forcing the attacker to adopt tactics around the rear. The grade of the fence is divided into two grades from 1 to 2. The first-level fence can only prevent infantry units from crossing over, and the second-level fence needs to consumes resources to upgrade the anti-tank hedgehogs, which can prevent tanks from infiltrating, and the advantage of expensive helicopter units is that they can directly infiltrate all partitions regardless of the internal wall defense. 2. The way the army moves. The move navigation systems of the three armies are based on the same navigation grid plane. This navigation road network is built according to the terrain, and many key paths only connect to a unique partition of the city base.

The defender can use this blocking strategy to delay the enemy's marching time . 3. Combat system and numerical introduction. There are two battle modes: urban battle and field battle. Urban battle is automatically triggered after the attacker moves to the defender's base through pathfinding. It should be noted that the attack route choice of the attacker will affect the location of the attack zone. It is automatically determined by the route and the geographical distance of the urban area. Combined with the aforementioned base divisions, this setting provides a large space for tactical choices in urban battles. Field battlefield battles are automatically triggered after the two armies collide in the field pathfinding area. This will generate a field battlefield battle collision body at the trigger point. All troops passing through this area will automatically enter the battlefield until the small-scale battle is won. Negative, this field battlefield also includes the fronts of the attacking sides. Normally, each side has a 180-degree back. Will be at a disadvantage in terms of combat values. The combat value algorithm is introduced below. Each army of the two parties involved in the battle has a combat power (ce) value. This value is manually edited during the process of creating an army. Different military types have different upper and lower limits of combat power. In the two combat modes , respectively calculate the sum of the respective combat power of the two armies participating in the battle, and the party with the leading combat power value will have an advantage in the battle damage ratio. In addition, in the urban battle mode, the area on the right side of the defender can provide additional supplies, and the defender can gain Battle damage ratio advantage, this function only takes effect when the area on the right side of the base is not occupied.

It does not trigger ground battlefield operations. Each interception area is only responsible for the interception mission of the bases inside the area. , can reduce the hit rate of missiles. 5. The aircraft carrier and its combat methods. When the game reaches level 5, the aircraft carriers of both sides are unlocked in their respective ports. Before using the aircraft carrier, the train station needs to send trains to transport fuel and steel resources to the port. The cities along the two railways can speed up the train speed, especially the trains that need special protection The safety of the base of the station originating station determines whether the train can be used. When the aircraft carrier route is edited and the aircraft carrier departs and lands, you can use the carrier-based reconnaissance aircraft function. This reconnaissance aircraft will fly in the area near the shore to interfere with the interception success rate of the enemy's anti-missile interception system in the area and improve the interception success rate.

You can also send troops to board the aircraft carrier before departure, and use the landing function to land troops when the aircraft carrier docks at sea.

To succeed, working with your partner is absolutely vital. You know that saying about teamwork making the dream work? It’s a little cliché, but totally true when playing River Tails. Nail-biting boss fights They can be pretty scary, but having mastered the key co-op mechanics earlier in the game you will have all necessary skills to defeat these angry enemies. Just keep calm and work together. Bosses aren’t evil, but they do have some anger issues for which they should really seek professional help. They are very protective of their turf and aren’t best pleased when a lively kitten and a cool-guy fish get too close. Play a co-op game in a challenging single-player mode! River Tails is designed specifically for two players, but we didn't like the idea of a game that can only be played in one way. That's why we added the LoneWolf mode. We have added a special control mode that allows you to play as both characters using one controller. The coordination becomes between one part of your brain and the other!

Although originally there were more than three thousand Nodes, the number of operational dome-cities is not known at present. Political instability and constant internal conflicts, as well as the altercations that occurred during the insurrection of the rebel coalition of Diurna against the government of the Regency of Omnis, provoked confrontations that, in many cases, ended with the total destruction of the structures that provide vital support to the domes.

65620,創業王 CEO,2023-01-20,9.99,0,"T-Time Technology CO., LTD.","T-Time Technology CO., LTD.","Simulation,Strategy",享受億萬富豪的美妙滋味! 在這款講求高度擬真性的遊戲中，玩家將可以自選１２大行業，權衡地利與價錢後買地設廠，依員工工作動線及各項生產設備來佈置廠房，還要從數百種的原料組合出市場需求的商品，是一個商業體系的完整縮影。玩家將體會從無到有、白手起家的創業過程，甚至在經過一連串激烈的商業競爭之後，擠身金融界鉅子的行列！ 掌握時代脈動，開創致富捷徑！ 「創業王」的遊戲背景時間設定在西元1960年，是正值經濟起飛的年代。玩家 扮演的角色是個白手起家的生意人，面對殘酷商場的弱肉強食和爾虞我詐，要為自己的企業找到一條生存之道可不是一件容易的事。遊戲初期玩家的資本額可能只夠開設一家小小的零售店面，必須藉由低買高賣，賺取價差來維持盈收。這個階段收集資訊是很重要的工作，玩家在了解市場的動向和物價的波動之後，再決定引進販售什麼樣的商品，較能夠有效的賺取利潤。也許今年夏天電風扇還是熱門商品，明年大家就改用冷氣機了，跟不上時代潮流可是很容易遭到市場淘汰的哦！一但抓住消費者的胃口，就有可能在短時間之內快速累積資本，稱霸零售事業了。但是聰明的玩家們豈能因此而滿足呢？ 地段選擇很重要　好的開始是成功的一半！ 購買土地是創業的第一步，原料的來源處會決定你將付出的運輸成本，另一個要考慮的就是商品的銷售對象。在「創業王」的都市中，在在著辦公區、高級及一般住宅區、商業區、工業區和文教區等不同的消費族群，如果你準備銷售化妝用品，就必須買下人口密度高的土地，再蓋一棟外觀美美的銷售中心，顧客才會有較高的意願來你的店裡銷費，否則就算你賣的再便宜，也很少有女性顧客願意大它遠跑到工業區去買一條口紅吧！除此之外，玩家也要有注意未來生產中心或銷售中心的擴展性。如果經營的成果愈來愈好，又剛好遇到旁邊有土地出售，玩家就可以直接買下旁邊的土地，就算一時錢不夠，也要變賣現貨湊錢買下來，一時的投資可以在未來省下更多的成本！當然也提供您另一種玩法，就是購地置產低買高賣，也許投資正確運氣又好，一夕致富就此成為大地主！ 佈置廠房空間　邁向百分百生產力的夢幻生產線！ 在遊戲中，玩家可以設計自己的生產中心或銷售中心，如配置生產機器，規劃成品及原料庫存區以及出貨區…等。在徧遠的工廠，還要考慮加蓋員工宿舎，否則再高的薪水也可能招不到足夠的工人來為你工作。在遊戲中，讓每一台機器都維持在生產狀態是很重要的，每台機器都需要人員來操作，而在佈置機器座向時，還要注意原料到製成成品的生產線是否過遠，否則還得花時間由工人來搬運原料。工廠內必備的建物有囤貨用的棧板和生產開發用的機器，因應不同產業的需要，可供選擇的機器種類與外型也有數百種之多。工廠內部機器的數量和架設位置，對生產動線和流程可是有著絕對的影響。玩家如果沒有詳細區隔原料和商品的倉庫空間，工人們可能會無所適從。零售店內則是以販賣用的收銀台和人力調配為主，而零售門市的人力分配與商品的陳設，都會直接反映在消費者的行為上。服務人員太少或是收銀台太遠，客人們可是會怨聲四起的。由於土地取得不易，為了發揮有限空間的最大經濟效益，玩家們必須考量的層面可不再只是單純的視覺美感。能否確實利用每一吋土地，發揮工廠的最大產能並讓客人享受到完善的服務，對企業的獲利有著絕對的影響，也是創業過程不可或缺的能力。 自由組合數百種原料，創意研發理想商品！ 「創業王」裡琳瑯滿目的商品是由許多不同的元件所構成。玩家必須親自嘗試各種不同的組合可能性。遊戲中從最基本的礦業、原油、家畜與農作物等開始，你可以進一步合成塑膠、鋼鐵、皮革、食品等進階原料，最後開發出IC電路板、車體、馬達、油墨染料之類的高階原件。當然玩家也不是一開始就可以隨意開發自己想要的產品，越是複雜的產品就需要越多來自不同產業的原料。例如汽車就是由引擎、車體、輪胎等元件組合而成，而輪胎又是由橡膠、鋼鐵等原料製成。你必須隨時掌握業界的最新資訊，投資一定的人力物力下去研發機器和新商品的製作方法，萬一對手先研發出來，你也可以購買其他廠商開發的商品再加以組合之後，也能創造出自己心目中的理想產品。玩家不但可以享受成本規劃的策略性和創造發展的成就感，還可盡情探索由民生百業交織而成的龐大商業體系。遊戲中的時間從西元1960年開始，玩家可以領先時代潮流創造出像電視遊樂器、流行服飾、舒適房車與高級家電等劃時代的產品，藉由提升市場佔有率而成為領導品牌！ 豐富的任務關卡模式　真實呈現商場激烈競爭的多樣AI！ 「創業王」採用獨特的AI系統，細膩的刻劃出商場上的爾虞我詐。遊戲中有２０多位不同的電腦對手，這些對手可能是保守型或攻擊型，如果遇上瘋狂削價的對手，他一旦發現你降價求售，他一定會和你拼到底；也有喜歡佔地的對手，一天到晚買地等增值， 存錢和你慢慢玩。除了真實的人性經營，還有不同背景的對手設定，如財閥，礦業大亨，以店多取勝的零售商，還有討人厭的“田驕子”…等，他們和玩家的關係可能是亦敵亦友，早期你可能專心從事汽車製造，再將你的汽車交給零售商來販售，但隨著時間過去，曾經小小的零售商也可能成立汽車製造廠，這時如果玩家還不想辦法早早往上下游拓展，你的競爭優勢很可能在一瞬間就崩潰了。 此外，遊戲還設計了特殊關卡模式，玩家必須達成關卡要求的目標，也許是２０萬小額創業基金的鹹魚翻身專案，或者是面臨新產業競爭對手的加入，而遭逢轉行危機！無論如何，你的各項優秀經營記錄，也都將一一登入名人榜中，成為家諭戶曉的夢幻創業王！,17,169.83,2,345,0,True,2023

Pandemics, natural disasters, ghosts, and Yokai... The life of a fallen Onmyoji is renewed when a new 'threat' appears. ◆Synopsis A story in a world where Yokai coexist. In Hinomoto, a country that had chosen to coexist with Yokai, many incidents occur because of evil Yokai, but the existence of 'Onmyoji' was the way to solve these problems. However, a new 'Curse' has been spreading... Many Onmyoji have gathered to exorcise the 'Curse' except the protagonist 'Zen Kamono', due to being a member of a fallen onmyoji family. While researching on his own, he discovers that a 'kiss' is the most effective against the curse...! ◆Characters Hazuki Tsunashi 'I hear Onmyoji doesn't ask gods for help, but are you different?'

A 'Yoko' with a free spirit, who loves having fun and a drink. From her sketchy personality, it is questionable if she is an ally or a foe. It is said that she becomes a great Yokai when reaching nine tails, but she is still in the development process. Often called a doll because of her quiet nature with no ego. Takane 'I believe in you master. I know you will get through this crisis.' A Shikigami that serves Zen. Being together since childhood, there is a special bond between them. Obedient, but sometimes teases Zen. To her, Zen is a master she adores with all her heart, a child in need of care, but sometimes thinks of him as a husband. Nagisa Tsunashi 'She's becoming a great girl. She could be the one saving Hinomoto.' Hazuki's mother who is retired, but still possesses the strong powers of a priestess. There is no priestess in Hinomoto who doesn't know her name. She looks calm and gentle, but really smart. She is a widow but she is happy to spend her days with Hazuki.

Now it's just released in the first year of senior high school Language setting: '设置' -&gt;'English' --------------------- In the 32nd century, the breakthrough of hyperspace technology enabled mankind to get rid of the limit of light speed, leave the solar system and the first 50 interstellar colonies, and move towards the further unknown deep space. Shortly after the hyperspace technology was put into use, the Earth Federal Government invested heavily to set up a fleet of starships equipped with hyperspace engines to explore the galaxies 100 light years away that were hard to reach by previous sub light speed spacecraft. However, due to the course deviation caused by the failure of the central computer, the starship you command did not reach the target galaxy, but headed in an unknown direction. You will play the captain of one of the starships. On the voyage, you may encounter various emergencies, cosmic wonders and cultural relics. In addition, exploration of deep space and colonization require resources, so you need to collect resources on various planets to meet your needs and finally find your way home and explore the forbidden area of the universe. Resource system: the most critical resources are metal and hydrogen. Metal can build facilities and repair ship bodies. Hydrogen is the main source of energy for starships. Other resources such as methane can also produce energy, but the efficiency is extremely low and can only be used as backup energy. Construction system: on a starship, you can use metal to build or upgrade your facilities. Different facilities have different functions. Science and technology system: in the late stage of extremely abundant resources, you can use a large number of metals to study science and technology to greatly facilitate your navigation Inspiration: this game was originally designed because there was no money to buy 'Out there Omega', so I wanted to imitate a similar game",2,9.0,0,348,23,True,2023

We are happy to present you THE MOON HELL ABOUT GAME THE MOON HELL is a third-person action RPG set in a fantasy mood in all game elements: sound, levels, light, atmosphere and other. We designed the levels of the game with an explicit goal to encourage exploration. Players who decide to visit every last nook and cranny of the map will be aptly rewarded for their curiosity. Players will also have the freedom to choose their own path and gradually get to know the world of the game. On their way to the final confrontation, players will be fighting many unique enemy types and brutal bosses. FEATURES OF THE PROJECT Players can expect between 8 and 20 hours of gameplay (depending on how they play), as well as: - 6 unique locations with a unique atmosphere - Non target combat system, which depends on the selected weapon - AI variety - each AI has its own habits and character of combat - A variety of weapons, shields and armor - Secret places - An interesting study of every corner of the location ABOUT THE COMBAT SYSTEM Our title is built around a bespoke non-target action combat system. We designed it to make every punch visceral. A successful strike on an enemy makes you feel the crushing weight of the blow. Every time the player’s character gets hit, it’s impossible not to flinch. The camera is tied to the action, giving players total control over their character. The game features four different weapon classes, each built for a completely different playstyle. We based one of the pillars of our game’s design on a simple idea: at all times, the player should feel their next mistake can be their last.",47,563.53,28,318,0,True,2023

As fate would have it, he has found himself as poor as rats, being forced to dedicate himself to a little-appreciated 'art': the appropriation of other people's property. But of course, this new lifestyle brings with it some added risks... Goody is thinking of leaving this life and never do an ounce of work, but for that he needs a lot, a lot of money. His latest plan consists of the BIG BANK ASSAULT (yes, in capital letters), something that will not be easy, especially because the city is besieged by enormous dangers for such a distinguished thief. Rodríguez, a police officer, is trying to catch Goody and put him in jail, thus securing his prized promotion in the force. In addition, 'Charly el Bardeos', a notorious and unsubtle crook who envies Goody and wants to 'steal' all the money he has on him, is roaming the streets of the city.

She put it on monitor, so that I could finally see the bubble’s inner structures——or, AI re-colored inner structures——clearly this time. We stare at the monitor as if it’s a new born baby, while the bubble roars in the Electromagnetic Cage back in the assemblies. We are all excited. Its inner structures are also made of squares.

But if expanding too fast, it wouldn’t be able to maintain itself. But if you release some tension, some energy from inside, the expanding could be slowed down, then we get a balloon which expands steadily while leaking.

[Machine Clanking] Eng: But What does this have to do with colonization? Cap: Ash is not tasked to colonize, she is testing energy extractions from R.U.B.I.K..

All I want is to check the Rapid Deployment Units now. Cap: Force enter if she doesn’t response. Ash: I’m sorry Captain, you are not permitted to enter load at unspecified time period. Cap: Permission? I’m coming in, either way. Ash: I’m sorry—— Cap: Have your Rapid Deployment Units managed to retrieve before the explosion? Ash: Captain, I must clarify to you again, that what were deployed into R.U.B.I.K. during the testing are, and will be merely 2-dimensional projections of our units, rather than themselves, and no life form has faced life danger—— Doc: Then let us in! Ash: I must reject. [Loud metal crack] Cap: What is that noise? What are you doing Ash? Doc: She captured another bubble! [Loud noise] [Speech Logbook out] Logbook D 1day 01:11 AM Navigator Good news is that we took back control over load. Bad news is that Ash blew the whole ship up. We worked ourselves to the bone to maintain the ship’s position. But the dimensional gradient is too high here. Something has happened to our bodies. But we can’t waste our energy to re-adjust position. We still have spare energy sufficient for 3 days. Rescue message broadcasted. Wait. [Speech Logbook] [Continuous electrical noise] Doc: All gone. Only empty capsules left. Eng, what have you found? Eng: Several Intelligent Modules left. Nav: What about spare energy? Eng: Ash must have used all energy. Nav: No energy......we still have to wait for rescue. Eng: F**king freezing cold here. Doc: Take a look at the labels on inner capsule: Fortress, Knight, Hermit, Bomb, Miner......That’s my first time seeing this......anybody know what is the number in the upper right corner? Some......kind of capacity? Ability? Nav: All I know is that higher the number is, louder the noises the unit make. Doc: “Ratio......Scaled......R.U.B.I.K.

A LOT. Not enough even we shut down that electromagnetic cage. Cap: But you are 120% sure you can jump start that spare engine? With enough energy? Eng: Easy as riding bikes. OK I know what you mean......I can rearrange the ship’s energy distribution, I can use the energy to control the Manipulator Arm, I can bypass Ash to capture a bubble for us. No problem. The main issue is—— Cap: There are Intelligent Modules. I’ll deploy them, collect enough energy for us, raise dimension and jump start the engine. And then we leave. That’s all. Nothing else. Cap: I checked Ash’s console. Green cells release energy, red ones absorb. Deeper the color, higher the amplitude. All I need to do is to move the units to appropriate cells, and cells will release or absorb energy through them. Simple. Oh, right, negative unit abilities reverse releasing and absorbing. That’s all. Just like a game. Eng: Alright. Cap: There are countless bubbles beneath us. Theoretically we could play countless bubble games. Eng: The main issue is, I’m afraid, that our remaining energy is only enough for one game. Only one shot. Cap: Okay. Cap: Don’t wait until we don’t even have enough energy for one shot, then.

How fast do you think time flows there? Is it possible for high-intelligent civils to appear in some universes, just like us? Nav: I begged Cap, the other day, that once we back, instead of tell them everything, we just make up a story. “We found nothing but celestial storms”, and “don’t send ships anymore”. Eng: Hug. They don’t need building oil drilling platforms any more. Not even Fusion Reactors. [Speech Logbook finish] Logbook D 4day Enter log time here Enter log recorder here [Speech Logbook] Nav: Come on, say something. Eng: Damn Co-op, f**k it. I f**king knew. There is no good having a high authority AI with a f**king secret mission on board. Shit, my head aches. Cap: Doc? Doc: I have some pain killer pills. And some anti-hypertensives. Eng: Only shitheads eat pain killer pills. I still want my brain to function. Cap: Chill, lay yourself down. It might slow down the internal bleeding. And we all took some pills, you might as well have some. Eng: The ship is drifting, slowly, but my guts can feel it. Drifting higher and higher. Feels like a submarine, diving into the deepest trench. The explosion aftermath did not disappear. It got into my body. Nav: Believe me, I’m more that certain that our ship is steady. Doc: I wonder if it would be better if we are all K.I.A. in the explosion? Nav: Nice thought, but could you make it more positive? Doc: Maybe we should reduce ourselves into total 2 dimensional creatures and all hide into some random bubble we capture. I think we would survive longer this way. Nav: You see, this is more positive. Doc: Come on, save your words. Eng: Such a nice thought, I wonder if there are 2 dimensional mosquitoes there. Cap: Flee into bubbles, we shall not be found by rescue anymore. Guys, we don’t have choices now, but we could still have hope. Let’s just be faithful for a while. Eng: Hey, I can catch a new bubble for y’all. No bullshit. Nav: No, there is no energy for us to use. Eng: Yes there is. We all put on spacesuits, then shut down the whole ship’s life-sustaining system, and re-distribute the energy to manipulator...... Doc: You are talking big. Eng: Yeah. That’s not enough. We also need spacesuits’ spare batteries. Doc: All-in, hug? Eng: Right. Jet the compressed oxygen out to adjust position. Doc: Do you think we can find a nice big 2 dimensional french meal in the bubbles? Cap: Everyone. Nav: Perhaps we could find 2d livings there. Paper people. Cap: Everyone. Put on your spacesuits. Nav: What? Cap: You heard Eng, we still have one more shot. Cap: We capture a new bubble, deploy a R.U.B.I.K. on it, and......start a new game. We will collect energy this time. Nav: Cap, we have lost all units. Nothing to deploy. Cap: I’ll deploy myself. Doc: No way! Cap: Listen up. Navigator takes over command after my deploy. Remember, Nav, there is a turn countdown at the upper right corner of your monitor panel. The bubble explodes after turns counts down to 0. But if you collect enough energy before that, the bubble would expand instead of explode, which buys you extra turns. Collect as much as you can before turns burn out. Cap: You only have time to commit 1 command after every cell reshuffle, unless the bubble expands, which gives you a chance to commit a long term command, or policy, as Ash calls it. Nav: Captain! Cap: Don’t detour if you could go through boundaries. Observe the panel. Skip commands you don’t need. Eng: I like it. I like this idea. Let’s get started. Doc: It might as well to deploy me. Please. Cap: No, I’m the commander, I’m responsible......for the whole thing as well. Navigator, set coordinates right away. Engineer, get the manipulator ready. Doc, prepare 4 sleeping capsules. 4.

Caught up in the groove, she recruits a group of hometown amateurs to take on art school darlings La Tormenta at the Battle of the Bands. Time-based sokoban-style puzzles Character-driven story set in 1990s suburban America Strategy-esque squad resources and rewindable turns to optimize your solutions Sequenced combo moves and 40 levels of strategic madness Join Watts as she grows on a musical journey rooted in funk and fusion. Soulful grooves and hot licks are composed by Pete Fraser, session saxophonist to the The Pogues, Friendly Fires, and Field Music! Twenty musical motifs are recorded by a live ensemble of seven funk masters, providing the foundation for the dynamic music in the game. Unique songs are generated depending on what directions and paths you take in each puzzle. Customize your performance with alternate playing styles, instruments swaps, and realtime audio effect pedals. Each character in your band moves through the sokoban puzzle maps in different ways, encountering unique solutions and obstacles. Advancing a character consumes a turn and part of the timeline, setting up interactions with other characters and enemies at different points in time. Rewinding a turn undoes your move, allowing you to find improved solutions and new ways to tackle problems. Manipulate each character separately, rewinding or fast-forwarding along the timeline in the process to reach her current point in time. Changes in time are reflected in the progress and actions both past and present of each character, creating some possibilities and removing others. Each character has his own resource-limited super move which can be triggered under certain conditions. Tip toe through tight spaces with your bassist, slide through guards with your keytar player, break through walls with your drummer, or blow enemies out of the way with your mighty super sax. Strategic use of your super moves increase the number of solutions to each puzzle and are the key in gaining a maximum score. Four resource-based musical metrics govern how and when you can move and interact with objects in the levels. These can completely block progress if used inefficiently, and create amazing musical chains and high scores when regulated artfully. Backbeat is a homage to the 16 and 32-bit story-driven games of the 1990s, recreating the challenges and victories of the last days of analog life and the birth of the internet. The suburban Washington D.C. area is reflected in diner parking lots, shopping malls, and dimly lit arcades.

I think there are some things you should know before starting this mission. A boy who lived in this house many years ago invites his friends to the house. Adventure-seeking children want to talk to a deceased relative using the ouija board. But things don't go well. Unfortunately, the person who came with the established connection was not the person they expected. A malevolent soul came to this world with the connection established. The first thing he did as soon as he arrived was to kill those who summoned him. The common views of the psychics who came to examine the house after this event caused this house to be abandoned. The psychics said that an evil soul possessed this house and that he had divided his soul into objects so as not to be destroyed. So this soul is very smart and very dangerous. Now you know the story of this house. Let me give you a few more tips. If you enter the house with your team to destroy this soul, this soul will take over the body of the one you. And it will try to prevent you from destroying it by killing you. I told you he was smart and dangerous. In this case, the person you think is from your team can become a soul and kill you. Or you can become a soul and kill your team. The last clue I can give you is that the psychics have determined that the evil soul is dividing its soul into the voodoo dolls in the house. What you need to do is to pay attention to those around you while collecting the voodoo dolls at home. Don't be distracted by the corpses you can see while you're trying to complete your quest. Once all the voodoo dolls have been captured, the spirit will perish And one last thing. Don't worry about what will happen if you are the chosen one. Remember it wasn't you! Be careful!... Single Player Mode Compete against the clock in single-player mode. There are 10 voodoo dolls that you must collect in order to destroy the soul entity within the specified time.

Multiplayer Mode (4-10 players) Reach heights of fun and tension by playing with your friends in multiplayer mode. Specify how many players there will be at most during the game setup phase and how many of them will be soul entities. And start the tension-filled minutes by inviting your friends to the game. Roles The game has 2 roles: Soul entity and human. And according to the role you have, here are the things you should do; Soul Entity Role Remember, your whole soul is divided into voodoo dolls. If all the voodoo dolls are gone, you're gone too. That's why you have to kill all the people without revealing yourself. Sometimes in the game, there may be different spirits like you. But you will not know that they are spirits. So you really have to make sure you're trying to kill a person. Because you don't kill souls and you don't want to waste time. Note: You must remember that you cannot kill people in a row. You can kill another human after a certain amount of time, so you have to strategize accordingly. Human Role The goal is to destroy the soul entity and the only way is to have all the voodoo dolls in the game collected. While collecting voodoo dolls, you have to stand by them for a certain period of time. That's why you have to be very careful. Because you will not know who is a human and who is a soul entity. You still have to collect and destroy the voodoo dolls if you die. Remember, the only way for the soul entity to die is for all the voodoo dolls to perish. So even if you are a dead person, you have to help the living people. Try to play without fear because tension-filled moments are waiting for you.

67447,Lattice Dancer,2023-03-08,2.69,0,SHELL Productions,SHELL Productions,"Action,Casual,Indie","Basically, avoid lasers by moving and use jumps and special moves only when they are really dangerous. The camera is intentionally fixed in its movement. Special moves have an invincibility time of 0.5 seconds. Get lost in the rhythm and feel the beat as you become fully immersed in the action. Don't be fooled by its compact design - this game is sure to leave you wanting more! To begin, the player must choose one of the two dancers available. The objective of the game is to avoid the lattice lasers. The dance ends when you touch the laser three times. The controls are straightforward and consist of three actions: 'Move,' 'Jump,' and 'Special'. The dancers dance on their own, so the player only needs to focus on using the controls to dodge the lasers. The 'Special' move makes it easier to avoid the lasers by lowering the dancer's posture and providing a brief period of invincibility. However, after this period, the dancer becomes vulnerable again, and if hit during this time, it counts as two hits, making it a high-risk move. At the end of each playthrough, the player is awarded a score and one of eleven levels of titles based on their performance. Taking risks, such as staying in the lattice or upstage, increases the score, but it's important to enjoy dodging the lasers rather than maximizing points. The game tests spatial awareness and concentration, so why not try improving these skills? Even if you don't understand the language, you only need to know 'play' and 'restart' to get started.",1,2.69,1,298,11,True,2023

66332,Nuclear War Simulator,2023-02-02,29.99,0,Bit Mirror,Slitherine Ltd.,Simulation,"Info section: Nuclear War Simulator is a detailed realistic simulation and visualization of large-scale nuclear conflicts with a focus on humanitarian consequences. There are currently over 13000 nuclear weapons on this planet of which over 9000 are in military stockpiles. This software should help you answer the question: what will happen if Russia and the United States or India and Pakistan use their arsenals? You can design warheads, missiles and carries, place them on the map and execute attack plans to tell a credible story about how nuclear conflicts play out and what are the consequences. Using a high-resolution population density map and realistic weapons effects like blast, heat and radiation you can make an estimate of how many people will die in a conflict. Nuclear conflict scenarios You can design realistic large-scale scenarios between major powers with thousands of warheads. Scenarios can be created manually where you can assign each warhead individually or with the assistance of an AI for faster targeting. It is also possible to simulate whole conflicts with a few clicks on the map interactively. You can download scenarios created by other people and upload your scenarios to the mods.io server. Realistic effects of nuclear weapons The simulation includes a high-resolution population density grid. The effects of blast, heat, fires and radiation are calculated and visualized for each population cell to estimate fatalities (similar to Alex Wellerstein’s NUKEMAP). The destruction of military targets is simulated using a model considering the CEP of the weapon, target hardness and cratering. You can place yourself, your family and friends into the simulation to estimate the expected injuries and survival probability. The amount of burnt fuel and produced soot are also calculated to estimate the effects of nuclear winter using a simplified model. Design and placement of objects Using an intuitive UI you can design warheads, place them on missiles and into silos, on aircraft, TELs and submarines. You can then place the forces onto the map simply clicking on it or importing real-world locations from KMZ files. If you know how much uranium and plutonium is needed for one warhead, you can estimate how many can be build from today’s stockpiles if a country wants to. Modding and interfaces The simulation supports some basic modding of unit textures, loading screens and background music. It is also possible to share unit blueprints and scenarios with others. If you have simulated a conflict in another tool you can import the list of detonations as a simple CSV file to calculate the humanitarian effects. On the other hand, you can also export the list of detonations together with the burnt soot into other tools like detailed climate simulations. Features Detailed effects of nuclear weapons, accurate reports on affects/results (including but not limited to radiation zones, casualties and fires) Realistic delivery systems, up-to-date full known arsenal of main world powers. Sandbox to design weapon systems and build conflict scenarios. Individual civilians moving on the map and taking shelter. 22+ predefined editable scenarios.  In-game mod upload and download. (instant synchronisation) Adjustable AI. Integrated early warning and Missile Defence systems.",76,2279.24,14,332,0,True,2023
