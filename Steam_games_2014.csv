It's 1991, and things are bad. You're a guy with a house and family. Other players are coming to take what's yours. Build security to stop them. Study their houses, buy tools, and break in to take what's theirs. Everything you do is permanent. I'm Jason Rohrer, and The Castle Doctrine is my 10th game. It's a bit hard to describe, because there's never been anything quite like it before. It's a brutal game in terms of its perma-death and perma-destruction consequences, and it is turn-based, so it's rather Rogue-like. But building such a brutal game in a multiplayer context, with absolutely no cushion between players to stop them from brutalizing each other, is quite strange and new. Everything is real in this game. When you rob someone, you are actually hurting another player in a permanent way by destroying and stealing their hard work. When someone dies in this game, they lose everything and start over. If you devise perplexing security systems, you can perma-death other players when they come to rob you. Watching those security tapes, where someone gets what's coming to them, is an exhilarating experience. On the other hand, you just killed someone and perhaps caused them to lose days of their hard work. And you've been on the other side too, losing everything because of some thoughtless move you made in someone else's house. But there is no randomness in this game, so everything is fair. When you die, it is always your fault. When things get dicey, you can always retreat back out the front door to save your own neck. Of course, human folly will get the better of you. Here's what you get when you buy the game: A lifetime account on the central world server that I'm running. Access to the full game source code (after launching the game on Steam, go here ).

55140,Steel & Steam: Episode 1,2014-07-16,0.0,4,Red Meat Games,Digerati Distribution,RPG,"Steel &amp; Steam is a Jrpg Fantasy Steampunk Adventure! The desert plague is spreading from the East: a reminder of a destructive past. Man has evolved since the wars of old, creating new ways to combat this deadly expanse. Using Steel and Steam, man fights this terror, as well as the monsters that spawn from its touch. Now covering half the continent of Terra Corpus, the desert’s slow and steady hunger is threatening to consume and corrupt all life in the world. Some of the desperate seek out legends of the past: elemental guardians said to sleep inside the planet. Once resurrected, these powerful beings can be controlled, and guided to stop the desert. The legends speak of a chosen few who have the ability to tame these elemental beings and reshape the world. Our story Begins With One Such Person. Steel &amp; Steam takes the best elements from the fantasy JRPG’s of old, such as great stories, awesome characters, and classic monsters, and combines them with a touch of steampunk. It’s like taking Lord of the Rings and mixing in the Wild West. It’s a game where you, the player, decide how to interact with the game. The classic games usually had a linear, player-focused story moving the game forward. Steel &amp; Steam follows this model, but also gives you the option of moving the story forward through multiple, intertwined story lines. Any character you meet has the potential to affect the end. Will you or will you not save the world? Who you interact with, and how, will affect the way the ending is played out. Whatever happens in one city or town can affect another. These choices give additional life to the world of Steel &amp; Steam. Who Are the Main Heroes Of Steel &amp; Steam? Noah Phoenix, age 19, 5’10, 170 lbs. Favourite weapons: sword, axe or pistol. Protective wear: shirts, light, medium and heavy coats. Noah is an adventure junky; he likes to jump in feet first, while searching for the next mystery around the corner. After a short stint with the Silver Head City Guard, Noah decided to move on as a freelancer. Without Alyssa to watch his back, he probably would have already bitten off more than he could chew. Alyssa Noble, age 21, 6’3, 180 lbs. Favourite weapons: fists, clubs or rifles. Protective wear: shirts, light, medium, and heavy corsets. Alyssa grew up learning how to fight by protecting her father’s caravans. She likes to step back and assess the situation, before laying it out cold with a good punch. Noah’s best friend and protector, she believes that if she wasn't around to watch Noah’s back, he would have been killed long ago. Here is an idea of some of the things you can expect from Steel &amp; Steam: A PC release: The game will be released for PC. A huge world to explore: The game is being designed as an immersive fantasy world. Cities and towns will be full of people and buildings to engage with, with story lines that characters can choose to follow regarding the history and current state of affairs that affect the day to day lives of the people who live here. An engaging story: An episodic story that involves two main heroes, with an epic conclusion. Choose your story: You have the chance to complete side missions that change how you interact with the world of Steel &amp; Steam. From changes to the characters you meet, all the way down to changes in the very landscapes you encounter, the side missions provide extra depth that unlocks new stories and opportunities to earn experience without the grind. Retro style gaming at its finest: Remember the glory days when games told epic stories? Steel &amp; Steam is a retro RPG similar to the classic RPG games played on the Sega Genesis, NES and SNES systems. Relive the past, relish the future, and revel in the now.

THAT would be what Petes job is all about - but luckily for him, he has a good customer paying his bills. It`s GlobalSecure Inc., one of the biggest insurance companies on the East Coast. More exactly, it`s Samantha 'Sam' Miller who runs their investigation department on insurance fraud. She`s tough, she`s intelligent, she`s better than Pete. By far better. But due to the companies Code of Conduct and some very nasty ethic rules, she`s prevented from taking, erm, 'semi-legal' steps to gain essential information and proofs. That`s where Pete steps in - for 500 bucks per day + expenses + a nice 20% share of the money the company saves with whatever Pete finds out.

The Director's Cut adds a host of new content and enhancements to the original game: 5 all-new missions, alternate endings, new music, a redesigned interface, team customization options, a revamped combat system, and more - making it the definitive version of this one-of-a-kind cyberpunk RPG experience. NOTE: The Director’s Cut is free to existing owners of the Dragonfall expansion for Shadowrun Returns . It will be automatically added to your Steam Library when the game is released. Man Meets Magic &amp; Machine In 2012, magic returned to our world, awakening powerful creatures of myth and legend. Among them was the Great Dragon Feuerschwinge, who emerged without warning from the mountains of Germany, unleashing fire, death, and untold destruction across the countryside. It took German forces nearly four months to finally shoot her down - and when they did, their victory became known as The Dragonfall. It’s 42 years later - 2054 - and the world has changed. Unchecked advances in technology have blurred the line between man and machine. Elves and trolls walk among us, ruthless corporations bleed the world dry, and Feuerschwinge’s reign of terror is just a distant memory. Germany is splintered - a stable anarchy known as the “Flux State” controls the city of Berlin. It’s a place where power is ephemeral, almost anything goes, and the right connections can be the difference between success and starvation. For you and your team of battle-scarred shadowrunners, there’s no better place to earn a quick payday. Now, a new threat is rising, one that could mean untold chaos and devastation. One that soon has you and your team caught on the wrong side of a deadly conspiracy. The only clue: whispers of the Dragonfall. Rumors that the Great Dragon Feuerschwinge may still be alive, waiting for the right moment to return… Shadowrun: Dragonfall - Director’s Cut Features A Classic, Story-Driven cRPG: Dragonfall hearkens back to the golden age of computer RPG’s with a novel-like branching narrative full of sharp prose and deep character development.

Shadowrun: Dragonfall - Director’s Cut is the perfect entry point to the setting for those with no prior Shadowrun experience, while providing plenty of classic Shadowrun characters and tech for veteran players to sink their teeth into. Command Your Team: Lead a small team of shadowrunners - each with their own outlook, motivations, and backstory. The members of your team are designed to play contrasting roles during missions, and each has a distinct set of skills, abilities, strengths, and weaknesses. But it’s not all about the mission - each team member also has challenges to face in their own lives, which you can choose to brush aside or play an important part in. Gripping, Turn-Based Tactical Combat: When you’re running the shadows, every turn matters. Choose your actions wisely - move to better cover, charge into melee, or lob a fireball into a crowd of enemies. With over 200 weapons and spells at your disposal, every turn is filled with meaningful choices. Skill-Based Character Progression: Choose a starting character archetype and build from there! Street Samurai and Physical Adepts use advanced combat skills to dominate the battlefield, Shamans and Mages summon powerful allies and cast deadly spells, while Riggers and Deckers provide critical technological support, projecting their consciousness directly into drones and computer systems.

New in the Director’s Cut Standalone: Due to popular demand, Dragonfall is now a completely standalone title!

These missions take you to previously-unseen locales - both within the Flux State and beyond - where you’ll have to face challenging enemies and make tough choices in order to help your team members prevail. Revamped Combat System: The Dragonfall combat system has received a major overhaul. An all-new armor system adds another tactical layer to the experience, while refined cover and damage mechanics emphasize the importance of battlefield positioning. Complementing these improvements is an upgraded AI system which reacts more intelligently and accurately to your actions. Redesigned Interface: The Dragonfall in-game interface has also been rebuilt. Spells, items and abilities are now much easier to access, while improved combat feedback allows you to fully understand the tactical situation in any given encounter. Customize Your Team: Guide your team members as they progress in each of their unique roles, choosing between different focus options to grant them new items and abilities. In addition, if you don’t like a team member’s default spell, item or weapon loadout, you can now customize what they bring on each mission.

251,SolidFace Parametric CAD Modeler 2D/3D,2014-12-22,0.0,0,"SolidFace Technology Inc.,Oscar L.",SolidFace Technology Inc.,"Animation & Modeling,Design & Illustration,Utilities","Part module SolidFace Sketch automatically creates parametric reference for modeling features that can be edited in a very simple and interactive way. This is an in-house developed module and fully integrated with the 3D module. SolidFace allows multiple bodies creation. A powerful tool helps in the development of dependent parts from a single part file. The parameterization allows not only an easy model editing, but also parts family creation that is an important issue in automating creation of variant models with the same constructive basis, such as fasteners, automotive, hydraulic and civil components. From a parametric part you can automatically generate dozens of others parts through parameters association, such as thickness, length, number and diameter of holes, color, material, information, text, etc. Assembly module Easy, accurate and effective, this module enables you to build assemblies using modeled parts and sub-assemblies. The automatic link between the modules facilitates the manipulation of assembly parts, thus any editing on a part or assembly, results in an automatic change in the assembly that references this component. You can build assemblies by inserting components created outside the assembly document; this is known as bottom-up assembling or if you need to construct a component that needs dimension references of some assembly components, you can create it, within the Assembly module. This operation is called in-context or top-down part creation. To facilitate the assembly process, the part elements can be enabled or disabled at any time without interfering the process of inserting (bottom-up) or creating (top-down) new components. Drawing module Besides the 2D draft capabilities explained in the SolidFace drawing product, you can also insert parts and assemblies into the drawing module in order to generate automatic orthographic, sections and details views. These views and dimensional annotations are created according to DIN and ANSI norms. Personalized by the designer. The 3D models views can be displayed in several model styles. The sections or details views are automatically created and aligned with the base view. Another advantage of the automatic link between the modules is the ability to copy and paste 2D geometric entities to the 3D Sketch module in order to use it as reference geometry to 3D features operations like extrude, revolve, etc. Exploded view An exploded view is a diagram, picture or technical drawing of an object, that shows the relationship or order of assembly of various parts. This allows the components (parts and sub-assemblies) to be visualized with defined displacements. The exploded view can be enabled or disabled at any time of the project creation. 3D Direct modeling Interact directly with the geometry of the model. Manipulate it by pushing, pulling, or twisting. Keeping the steps that create the final model, direct modelling allows the features geometry to be parametric modified by editing the feature used to create the new faces. 2D/3D Movement simulation One of the many capabilities of logical conditions is to enable the system to detect the collision of components assembly. The collision or the simulation process can be aborted and analyzed at any time. This makes possible not just a simple mechanism video demonstration but also a real-time movement simulation. The parameterization capability is one of the greatest advantages of SolidFace and it is present in all design steps. 3D Motion simulation is no different; the simulation is updated simultaneously with the movement. Another important capability is the simulation of 2D mechanisms, which can be performed either in 2D drawing or in 3D sketch module.

The game features the race to the Moon, the historical event that started in the early 1960s and that ended in July 1969, after the successful completion of the Apollo 11 mission. To verify its accuracy and authenticity, the game has been developed in consultation with Dr. Buzz Aldrin, former U.S. Air Force combat pilot (66 missions in Korea) and NASA astronaut, who took part in the first Moon landing mission and became the second human being to walk on the Moon. If you have any interest in space exploration and the events that transpired during the 'Race to the Moon', this is a game you just do not want to miss! It is the mid 1950s and the race for dominance between the US and the Soviet Union is about to move into a new dimension: space. Take charge of the US or Soviet space agencies - your duty is be the first to the moon. Carefully manage your budget by opening programs, spending R&amp;D funds on improving the hardware, recruiting personnel and launching space missions in this realistic turn based strategy game. The game features both a campaign and a sandbox mode. In campaign mode, you will be able to play as the Director of either NASA or the Soviet Space Agency in order to beat the other side to be the first on the Moon. You can also lead the  Global Space Agency (GSA), a fictional space agency that combines programs from all the major space agencies in the world . In the GSA campaign, you will need to address the requests and short-term goals issued by government, and is geared towards those players who prefer a game experience focused on exploration instead of competition.  Alternatively, all three space agencies feature a Sandbox mode, which provides a more open-ended experience and allows you to try out different approaches without any political pressure. You will be able to develop dozens of programs. Some examples include the X-15 and the PKA space planes, the Sputnik satellite, the Mercury, Voskhod, Apollo and Soyuz manned spacecraft and the Mars Viking probe. You are not limited to missions that did launch, as as the game also allows you to try out many concepts that were planned but that never left the drawing board. For example, instead of sending men to the Moon using the Lunar Orbit Rendezvous (LOR) approach used by Project Apollo in the late 1960s and early 1970s, you will be able to rewrite history and use either the alternative Gemini Earth Orbit Rendezvous (EOR) or Gemini Direct Ascent (DA) schemes. The number of options available ensure every game will be different and there is huge replay value. Features Three different campaign modes: play as NASA or the Soviet space agency in order to be the first on the Moon or play as the Global Space Agency (GSA) and deal with the short-term objectives issued by politicians. Manage all aspects of your space agencies from their inception in the 1950's through to the manned lunar landing missions Play the race to the Moon campaign mode against other players using Slitherine’s PBEM system. The Sandbox mode allows you to play as any of the three space agencies and removes all competition restrictions. You will have a fully featured playground in order to try out different approaches to space exploration! Create space programs and launch missions inspired by real programs such as the X-15 Space plane, the Sputnik satellite, the Gemini, Vostok and Apollo manned spacecraft and a lot more! Research and develop dozens of mission components from several program categories. Develop your facility with advanced structures and upgrades including the Vehicle Assembly Building and the Mission Control Centre. Recruit and train astronaut candidates and assign them to missions. Assemble an elite team of Scientists, Engineers, Technicians (SET), Flight Controllers for the best chance of success. Manage your agency's budget. Mission components have an associated reliability factor and can cause catastrophic failures. Vast amounts of historical research ensure that the game's huge database features missions that launched and many more that never left the drawing board! A vast array of components built in 3D and rendered out in exquisite detail allow you to follow the progress of your missions via animated sequences.

The game provides an experience of war seen from an entirely new angle. The pace of This War of Mine is imposed by the day and night cycle. During the day snipers outside stop you from leaving your refuge, so you need to focus on maintaining your hideout: crafting, trading and taking care of your survivors. At night, take one of your civilians on a mission to scavenge through a set of unique locations for items that will help you stay alive. Make life-and-death decisions driven by your conscience. Try to protect everybody from your shelter or sacrifice some of them for longer-term survival. During war, there are no good or bad decisions; there is only survival. The sooner you realize that, the better. This War of Mine - main features: Inspired by real-life events Control your survivors and manage your shelter Craft weapons, alcohol, beds or stoves – anything that helps you survive Make decisions - an often unforgiving and emotionally difficult experience Randomized world and characters every time you start a new game Charcoal-stylized aesthetics to complement the game's theme The universe of This War of Mine has been expanded by following DLCs: The Little Ones - explores the hardships of wartime survival as seen from an entirely new perspective - that of a child.

Each turn, you must decide where to go, how to scavenge for supplies, and how to deal with anything and anyone you encounter. And with each passing minute, the pit in your stomach grows, your dehydration worsens, your muscles tire, and your body temperature drops in the cold autumn air. Choose your starting abilities carefully, because they and your wit are the only tools you have in the apocalypse! Features Unique Setting - Near-future, post-apocalyptic Michigan with local cryptids and folklore. And something else beneath the surface... Turn-Based Play - Take your time with each turn, and play at your own pace. Save and quit when you want, and resume later. Permadeath - If you die, that's it. NEO Scavenger is balanced around a single difficulty level: permadeath. Your save will be deleted if you die. So choose every action carefully! No Grinding - There is no XP in NEO Scavenger. No levelling-up. Instead, progress comes from learning how to play the game better, and using your strengths to your advantage. Semi-Random - Much of the map is randomized each game, including the location of ruins, creatures, weather, and certain quest branches. Sandbox or Story - Search for clues to your identity, what happened, and who's hunting you. Or simply test your mettle against man and nature alike. Play how you want! Abilities and Flaws - Choose abilities and flaws each time you play. Different combos unlock different abilities and quest branches. Crafting - Extensive crafting system which allows for substitutions of similar items. Make a rifle scope from half a pair of binoculars, or a noise trap from a pill bottle and pebbles. Desperate Combat - Detailed combat with moves like 'Tackle,' 'Lure,' 'Kick While Down,' 'Demand Surrender,' and 'Threaten.' Realistic Wounds - Creatures have complex wound simulation, with multiple wound locations, infection, bleeding, and pain management. Realistic Metabolism - Hypothermia, fatigue, thirst, hunger, disease, intoxication, shelter...everything is tracked. Realistic Inventory - Complex inventory system with slots for holding, wearing, containers, and more. Fit items in grid spaces, and manage encumbrance. Hex-Based World Map - Navigate ruins, hills, forests, and plains in a hex-based map. Line-of-sight, elevation, and daylight matters. Tracking - Creatures leave their tracks and spoor on the map, which can be followed by others. Players can also hide their tracks. Hiding - Players can use hiding to avoid being seen while traveling the map, as well as during story encounters. Hunting - Trap small game for food and fur, or track and kill larger prey on the map for butchering. Hacking - Use hacking skills to unlock scavenged laptops, cellphones, smartphones, and tablets. Mine them for paydata, or snoop through personal files. Foraging - Search for edible plants and water, and use special skills to identify what's safe to eat. Haunting Soundtrack - Music composed by Josh Culler, specifically for NEO Scavenger, plays periodically, lending an atmosphere of loneliness and desperation. (Also accessible as mp3s outside game.) Creature AI - Wandering creatures go about their own business, hunting, scavenging, and hoarding. Morale affects their choices, and some will gang-up and cause trouble. Dynamic Weather - Temperature, rainfall, and night/day are based on real-world data for autumn in the area. If you live long enough, you may see snow fall. Detroit - Take refuge from the wasteland in one of mankind's last bastions of safety. Buy supplies, get medical care, and seek clues in a cyberpunk-styled city.

Who says RPGs have to be so serious? In a world of jaded heroes and veteran adventurers, you play a team of misfits: Arianna, a dainty warrior with an attitude problem; Dirk, an adrenaline-junky rogue who doesn’t seem to understand the word ‘subtle;’ Benjamin, a nature-priest and an ill-suited newcomer to the adventuring lifestyle, and Chloe, a ditsy sorceress with a love of cute, fuzzy animals and setting her enemies on fire. Adventuring is always a dangerous profession, but recently things have gotten bad. Very bad. Teams of expert fortune-hunters are getting 'morted,' suffering great losses against enemies that are better prepared than ever. In the taverns and Adventurer's Guildhalls, whispered rumors speak of the return of an evil that once all but destroyed civilization. But as many great and famous adventurers fall to this growing threat, perhaps this bunch of losers - called 'The Frayed Knights' (but never to their faces) - might just be the heroes the world really needs: The wrong people at the wrong time. Features: 30+ hours of gameplay. Challenging, turn-based combat in a game that plays at your pace. A unique 'Drama Star' system that rewards the player for playing through tough situations instead of reloading and replaying. A spell named, 'Power Word: Defenestrate.'

You'll explore mysterious locations, Mine blocks for resources, and meet strange (and some familiar) creatures, some of which don't even want to kill you and eat your corpse. Along the way, you'll be able to craft armor, weapons, gadgets and more to assist you in surviving in an inhospitable environment. Story Sensing that an apocalyptic war was imminent, the United Nations executed a last ditch plan to save what they could of the human race. 2 crafts were launched, a massive colony ship called the Hephaestus and a smaller, faster scout ship called the Hermes. The destination was a recently discovered earth-like planet with the potential to harbor life located roughly 18 light years away. The Hermes reached the planet first in order to establish a presence in anticipation of the arrival of the Hephaestus. 4 years later, as the Hephaestus approached its destination a faint signal was detected from a nearby asteroid. Against their better judgement, the crew of the Hephaestus decided to investigate, and in doing so set in motion a chain of events that would ultimately lead to their destruction. The good news is, you managed to survive by hitching a ride on a small escape pod just in the nick of time. The bad news is, everyone you knew and loved is dead, you have nothing but the clothes on your back, a standard issue multi-function wrist laser and a faulty artificial intelligence companion named AGIS. Oh, and the human race is probably doomed. Probably. Features An expansive world with procedurally generated and hand-crafted content. Online Co-Op Multiplayer A bunch of weird alien creatures.

Whether employing stealth or brute force, they were always deadly.

They now work for whoever can pay. And pay they do! Empires might span hundreds of planets and thousands of ships, but when a critical task arises, they still turn to an Operative.

The new development team is fixing and patching all elements in order to improve gameplay and reduce the amount of crashing. This has also resulted in a delay of patches, so game updates may be slow-going at first as we are doing a very large overhaul of back end systems. The Repopulation is a science fiction sandbox MMORPG which is currently in Early Access and early alpha testing. You should only consider purchasing the Early Access for this title if you are okay with bugs, crashes, possible interruptions of service, and in some cases fluctuating features, as well as to support the development of the game and help up us build it. The Repopulation is about player's choices in the way they play: being able to do Player vs Player or avoid it altogether, the ability to do Crafting and concentrate on it, or build your own home, having the freedom to advance your characters in a number of ways and not just through combat. Key Features Currently Available In Early Access Sandbox-driven gameplay which never forces you down a specific path. Skills-based advancement with over 75 skills including combat-oriented, diplomatic, rogue, entertainment, trade skill, pet, survival, and other advanced skills. Advanced trade skill systems which allow for a high degree of customization in crafted goods. Players can switch between RPG Mode or Action Mode combat at any time. Action Mode controls like a shooter, but is built on top of RPG mechanics. Create homes and build cities complete with vendors, props and defensive units. Dynamically-generated content which will change based on how players react to the world. Unique three-faction PvP system, where the third faction is allowed to set its alliances on a nation by nation basis. PvP is entirely optional with much of the world being protected from it and players being able to progress entirely without ever getting involved in PvP. Advanced generated mission system provides a never-ending stream of missions which are customized for your character. They are purely optional. Social-oriented features which provide bonus rewards when grouping or working together with other players. Vehicle system allows you to upgrade and custom tailor your vehicles, even adding abilities such as Shielding, Mines, Turbo Boost, or Combat abilities. Three different pet systems: Genetic Engineering, Taming, and Robotics. Engagement system which is similar to a mutating form of Public Quests. Persistent Seamless World.

Balance, feature refinement, bug fixes and content. Engine upgrades to take advantage of the most recent versions of Hero Engine. Server Availability Being an MMORPG the only way to play the game is online. We currently provide both US and EU servers and they are available as long as there is no scheduled maintenance or unforeseen issues that do arise during development and testing. We strive to keep the servers up and running as much as possible, but, as with any MMO, patching is needed and will require the servers to be down during the process. There might be other times when the servers are undergoing maintenance and will require downtime; we will try to effectively communicate this as much as possible. There are no current plans for player ran servers or single player options. 3rd Party Account This game requires a 3rd party account to play. A key will be given to you by Steam to activate the account so you can see the list of available servers to play. Please be sure after you purchase the game to create your account and register the key. A Stand-Alone client will also be available for purchase via the game’s website in the near future.

Instead of giving specific ones at each level we will offer you tokens and you will have a choice of different options, with some costing more than 1 token.

588,X-Plane 10 Global - 64 Bit,2014-07-14,0.0,16,Laminar Research,Aerosoft GmbH,Simulation,"X-Plane 10 Global is the latest version of a simulator that has been in development continuously for almost 20 years. This latest version of X-Plane 10 brings numerous improvements and enhancements for PC, Mac and Linux virtual pilots, unleashing the power of modern systems with its 64 bit processing and multi-core support. Designed to be the most flexible flight simulator it has a fully open structure that allows the enthusiast to change every part. With thousands of compatible add-ons there is no kind of flying craft that is not simulated and there is a whole world to explore. Boasting a 20 year old pedigree, X-Plane utilizes Incredible cloudscapes to bring the sky to life whilst the ground depicts real-world roads, cities, towns and more to ensure the most realistic flying experience possible. The completely new rendering engine shows the world around you in high detail and with global illumination so lights behave like real lights. The core is a virtual wind tunnel that creates the most realistic flight modeling available on a desktop. Equally capable of simulating every type of aircraft, the virtual pilot is able to experience the challenges of flying big airliners or tiny ultra-light aircraft. The realism of X-Plane 10 Global is proven by the fact that X-Plane is used as a certified training tool. Each aircraft flies just as it should, from the glider to the Space Shuttle! Air Traffic Control will guide you from startup to shut-down and also controls the other aircraft around you. Those other aircraft are not robotic as they are in other simulators, but they interact with the world in the same way as your own aircraft does. They will fight the same cross winds and turbulence as you encounter, they will need more runway to stop when the weather conditions are not favorable. Just like real pilots do, you will watch their take-off to be prepared for what your take-off will be like. It’s still simulated but it gets very close to real aviation! X-Plane 10 Global is built with the future in mind and makes full use of the hardware in your system. If you own a fast multi-core machine you will be able to simulate more aircraft around you and see more details but even with a moderate machine X-Plane 10 Global is capable of displaying a tremendous amount of objects without slowing down. Features Super accurate flight characteristics using a virtual wind tunnel Includes 30 aircraft, from gliders to the Space Shuttle Online flying with other virtual pilots Air Traffic Control actually controls the other aircraft around you Accurate terrain, roads and more Global ‘Plausible World’ auto generated scenery New rendering engine with innovative global lighting 64 Bit optimized Totally flexible and extendable with thousands of existing add-ons (and many more to come) Includes super-detailed scenery for Nice (LFMN), Paderborn-Lippstadt (EDLP) and Faro (LPFR) printed “Quick Start Guide” included Default Scenery Having installed the software via Steam you only have the main simulator as well as the Seattle region.

Check out the Community Hub for Frequently Asked Questions and other cool stuff! A BRIEF BACKGROUND Influent is a Language Learning Game focusing primarily on vocabulary acquisition and pronunciation. It was initially developed in Japan at the University of Tsukuba's Entertainment Computing Laboratory under the Monbukagakusho Government Research Scholarship . After research funding ran out, further funding from a wildly successful Kickstarter Campaign allowed for the completion of the game. A research paper on the ideas surrounding the game and its applications was published by the Information Processing Society of Japan (IPSJ), which can be viewed in its entirety here . Andrew Cross is infuriated! For three long years, he sat confined to his work, developing a device that he firmly believed to be a technological breakthrough in the way people would interact with the world around them. A device that could scan any object in the real world and then provide its name in any language! Duly dubbing his fancy new invention the 'SanjigenJiten,' Andrew arranged an appointment to demonstrate the device's amazing capabilities at the world's largest technology corporation, Technoglobe International. But while on his visit, he fell for a girl he met in the lab, and while she stole his heart, someone else silently stepped in and stole his device! Now, Technoglobe has gone and swiftly marketed the SanjigenJiten as their own, even laying claim to the very name he had so cleverly concocted! But Andrew Cross has a plan. He's made an even better version of his SanjigenJiten and launched an online campaign, swearing to learn 300 words in a foreign language to raise awareness of Technoglobe's blatant theft and prove his device really works! But does the SanjigenJiten really work? Can Andrew actually pull it off?!",1476,0.0,722,3573,32,True,2014
