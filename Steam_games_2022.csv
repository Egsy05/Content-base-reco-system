The male leading role Qin Xuan died and fell into hell, and found that the so-called hell was not the reincarnation place of souls as people said, but a horrible prison with evil ghosts--Hell of Sins. When the souls of the human dead fall into Hell of Sins, it will show its ferocious face. Conspiracy and killing, desire and plunder, struggle and hesitation, darkness and evil are all in it! Facing the horrible evil ghosts everywhere and the human souls that are mad and fallen in Hell of Sins, those souls who have yet been swallowed by the darkness start a difficult journey to survive... =Art Style= In Hell of Sins: soul, we have applied the black-and-white hand-painted style. In our opinion, hell should be a hopeless and desperate dark world. Therefore, the black-and-white painted style is the best interpretation of it. Meanwhile, the deep darkness will stimulate people's fear of the unknown. In aspects of characters, scenes and monsters, we have also learned the style of Mr. Junji Ito, a master of horror, and referred to elements of Cthulhu in the setting of monsters. The combination of these two factors can perfectly show the indescribable horror, and bring you a feast of fear that impact both your eyes and heart. =Features= To make sure that you can completely immerse yourself in Hell of Sins, we have jumped out of the traditional AVG way of telling the story with only scenes and stand drawings, but displayed most of the story with lots of beautiful CG. In some plots, we even have inserted wonderful animations and videos.

With wisdom, skill and bravery, you will progress through many events and locations from the biblical stories of young David. The Anointed: David Saves Keilah is a single-player, action-adventure game with platforming elements experienced in 3rd-person perspective. David traverses many locations; moving through the wilderness of Ziph, the Forest of Hereth, and the threshing floors and stronghold of Ancient Keilah, all in this single episode (1 Sam 23). As David, the player has the physical ability to walk, crawl, crouch, sprint, jump, vault over objects, climb on buildings, scale up walls, swing from ropes, and there is even a horse for those long runs through the wilderness. Although the story is linear, there are plenty of things to discover and many paths to take to fulfill each part of David's mission to save Keilah. There is a vast open-world feel with no time limits between objectives. There are loud thunderstorms and bright sunny skies, and David has a torch to light his way inside dark rooms/areas. Dialogues and Scrolls of information (Scripture) help guide David on the right path, while providing invaluable lessons. And, there are videos (Prayer Tips) that help the player navigate the challenges ahead. David's sling, staff, sword and spear are very useful weapons against the Philistines, the wild animals, and all the enemies of David - but Stealth and patience can be the most rewarding strategy. The Vitality, Righteousness, and Empowerment meters reflect the state of David during gameplay. Depleted Vitality (health) will force the player to start over from the last Save point, while Righteousness can be gained (stealth, scrolls, tips) through gameplay and used (V) to provide Holy Vision (a type of Xray).

Invention Of the Game Pentomino, or five grid dominoes, is known in China as the 'brain racking twelve pieces'(伤脑筋十二块) ,Some data records show that it was invented in the last century and many scholars have studied it. The invention of the well-known game 'Tetris' is based on the research and simplification of five grid dominoes. Personal guess: Maybe its invention history may go back hundreds or thousands of years. The five small square elements are very similar to Gobang(Renju), and gobang is a simplified version of Go. It is also very similar to the pattern on Chinese mahjong. And these games are very old. This fit space logic is very similar to the tenon and mortise structure. The tenon and mortise structure appeared and applied in ancient Egyptian civilization, Lianghe civilization and ancient China. Maybe this game is a tool or toy for ancient craftsmen to study the tenon and mortise architectural structure.

CONTENT ROADMAP Half-metal, half-human, all murder machine Heavily inspired by some of the all-time greats like Id's Doom &amp; Quake , and Apogee's Duke Nukem 3D , with stunning cyberpunk visuals, Turbo Overkill is the most savage FPS ever released by Apogee. You play as Johnny Turbo, augmented with hidden arm rockets and a chainsaw that extends from your lower leg allowing you to slide-slice enemies wide open. In this Blade Runner -meets- DOOM hellscape, Johnny returns to his hometown of Paradise and finds its entire population possessed by Syn, a rogue AI, and its army of augmented minions. Desperate for enough money to outrun his past mistakes, Johnny takes on the impossible job of destroying the greatest AI ever created. Rival bounty hunters want to claim the prize first. Nothing is easy in paradise. Turbo Time, wall-running, dashing and grappling hooks, oh my Turbo Overkill takes over-the-top to never-before-reached heights. Activate Turbo Time(™), a new form of slow motion with a twist. Build incredible speed by wall-running and dashing. Slide on your chainsaw leg, eviscerating foes and opening up bosses for critical damage, and go car-surfing on the hoods of flying cars. Blast away with the Twin Magnums, which lock-on and instagib several foes, the Boomer Shotgun and its attached grenade launcher, or the Telefragger sniper rifle, which teleports Johnny inside an enemy before they explode from within. Race through two dozen stages packed with secrets, bonus arena stages, and white-knuckle combat puzzles. Find game-changing collectibles to unlock punishing modifiers like triple-monster-speed and insta-kill. Combine all of Johnny’s weapons and powers to outsmart, outgun and outrun the corrupted legions. TL;DR: o Kill a boss, get its augment (special power) o Play Spider-Man with your grappling hook o One-up Duke Nukem with your chainsaw slide-slice kick o Kills = cash. Use cash to install augments, upgrade your weapons, and add new abilities in your talent tree o Be a ghost runner while wall running o Attack from above riding the hood of your flying car like a kung-furious badass o Mini-rockets built into your robotic arm? ✔ o This.

A ship that is protected by gold shields, the physical currency that has helped humanity in the last 5 thousand years, and where you can see how billions of dollars are thrown into the currency market thanks to the quantitative expansion of the FED. Coins Invaders was born in this format, a tribute to the great Japanese designer Toshihiro Nishikado and his famous video game Space Invaders from 1978, to reflect the unequal fight that Bitcoin has with other cryptocurrencies that arise from dark forces in the world to pervert good people and keep them prisoners on his communist Orwellian fiat money farm. If you believe in the success of Bitcoin, you can have fun destroying various altercoins in an all-out war. May the best cryptocurrency win! History After the 2008 crisis, an anonymous Internet user who identifies himself as Satoshi Nakamoto created Bitcoin as a new currency, a new decentralized digital asset designed to function as a medium of exchange that uses cryptography and the blockchain to control its creation and management that does not depend on the control of governments or central banks, to help people break free from the monetary madness of the Fed. Bitcoin was born as a decentralized currency, with peer-to-peer transactions to operate throughout the world. A safe currency and, to the horror of the bankers, unconfiscable by the state. On the Internet they begin to make fun of this new currency, disparagingly calling it, ''cryptocurrency'', but many begin to see its potential and in 2010 the first known exchange takes place: Laszlo Hanyecz bought two pizzas for 10,000 bitcoins, which at the time was equivalent at $ 30. That is, each Bitcoin was equal to $ 0.003. Many people start betting on Bitcoin and this scares the various manipulative forces in the world. Different cryptocurrencies are beginning to be created that want to take advantage of the prestige of Bitcoin to steal people's money and, incidentally, discredit Bitcoin. In 2014, when Bitcoin was already being exchanged for $ 1,000, a force from the dark side of the world tried to pervert Bitcoin by creating a new currency called Etherium. Although it is also based on cryptography and blockchain, many dark forces control this currency, it is no longer 100% decentralized and strange things come up like NFTs. And the first fight between cryptocurrencies begins. But the great manipulators of the money market, the bankers very friendly to the FED, could not let people go free again thanks to Bitcoin and conspired to create a new type of cryptocurrency, linked to the value of the dollar. And so Tether arises, a stable-coin whose value is linked to the dollar. It is the closest cryptocurrency to fiat money, to the dollar that has lost 90% of its value in the last 50 years, with which they want to confuse and deceive people of good will. As the subject of cryptography and blockchain is computer science, the world's large technology companies unite to try to stop Bitcoin with a new manipulative alternative and in 2019, Libra, the cryptocurrency of the technological ones. Although formally it is one of the great technologies that assumes the leadership of the currency, surely you have some of its apps on your smartphone, all the technologies are involved. Anything goes in this war to undermine trust in Bitcoin. But in a world where fiat money rules and unicorn companies flourish, social media memes have great power in the world. And a great of the world, with dreams of traveling to other worlds, takes advantage of his knowledge of this meme world to have fun promoting an old cryptocurrency that had been launched in memes: Dogecoin. And with the power of the meme, he sets out to try to conquer the world and become a millionaire through this cryptocurrency. And so there are many other cryptocurrencies that enter into a fight every year and several dozen cryptocurrencies are launched that try to obtain the savings of the good people who can still save. Thus, the world is now invaded by many currencies, by many cryptocurrencies that fight fiercely to survive, that try to destroy Bitcoin and take advantage of the good of humanity. Coins Invaders was born in this format, a tribute to the great Japanese designer Toshihiro Nishikado and his famous video game Space Invaders from 1978, to reflect the unequal fight that Bitcoin has with other cryptocurrencies that arise from dark forces in the world to pervert good people and keep them prisoners on his communist Orwellian fiat money farm.

Your goal is to delve deep into a dungeon, find a portal to a mythical place called the Zorbus, where a mere mortal can ascend to demigodhood. You can recruit other creatures along the way so you don't have to adventure alone. Being a roguelike game, Zorbus creates the dungeon randomly so that every played game is slightly different. The game uses permadeath, meaning that when a character dies, it really is permanent, and the player must begin a new game. You can save the game, but the save file is deleted when loaded. Zorbus does not have item identification or a hunger mechanic. A LIVING DUNGEON Thematically Zorbus draws influence from the late 70s and early 80s tabletop D&amp;D campaigns, adventures and lore. The game tries to create a dungeon which feels alive, eventful, and rich in content. Something more than just empty rooms and corridors. Diversely shaped levels with themed content (throne rooms, prisons, hidden treasure caches, etc.) with good connectivity between the areas. The dungeon denizens act intelligently, fight each other, flee when threatened, and try to gather their friends to overcome a threat. Most creatures can use items, and can also pick them up from the dungeon floor. Creatures are not silent either, but comment on things with speech bubbles. The dungeon has dynamic lighting. There are light sources as dungeon furniture and in the hands of creatures, and these both can be lit and unlit. Some creatures have darkvision. Creatures react to light and sound. RPG RULE SYSTEM The rule system for the game is slightly influenced by the d20 system used in the 3rd edition of Dungeons &amp; Dragons. Zorbus has experience levels but no character classes (race is selected). On each level up, you point buy skills and talents (mostly combat maneuvers and spells). CONTROLS &amp; UI Keybindings are configurable. Mouse control is supported, but is not ideal for playing the game. A game controller can be used.

Snowflake Warning If you are easily offended, please be advised this is not the game for you. It is widely anticipated to become the most controversial game on Steam! Overview In this star-studded third-person interactive visual novel, you play Dickie A. Cumming; a decorated war hero who has recently been discharged from the British army. As Dickie, you must come to terms with a new life on 'civi street' and a brave new world of 'wokeness', 'social justice warriors' and 'cancel culture'. But Dickie is rather an old-fashioned chap who will struggle to understand these new concepts. As he naively grapples with this new era and the challenges it presents, Dickie inevitably comes into conflict and encounters hostile resistance. And, as if things weren't complicated enough, he finds himself afflicted with a severe sex addiction! This is an erotic comedy that refuses to take itself (or the craziness of modern Western culture) too seriously! It represents the author's (often flawed) attempts to understand what is a rapidly changing political and societal landscape. Features Real influence - your decisions will truly influence the story. Up to four choices may be presented in a typical scene and each may lead to a new branch of the story. Dynamic and animated scenes - many scenes feature moving images, special effects and animations. 3D Sex - most of the many sex scenes are presented in 3D and animated (with audio).

Cards of the Dreaming Dragons is the ultimate tabletop game you can play with your friends and family and tests your understanding of how they think. In this world of fantasy, you must figure out what dreams other people had and accumulate more points than any other in order to win. This is an amazing experience with friends, because you want to figure out what they are thinking, all while trying to win. It’s a game of trust, but also of deceit and with its fair share of challenges. How do you play Cards of the Dreaming Dragons? Each turn, a player is assigned the role of the 'dreaming dragon'. The dreaming dragon selects a single card from their hand. This becomes their 'dream'. They will provide a phrase which describes their dream. Then each other player selects a card from their hand which best matches the phrase given by the dreaming dragon. Once all players have selected a card, each player (except the 'dreaming dragon') will guess the 'dream' from all the cards. How do you win Cards of the Dreaming Dragons? If all players correctly guess the 'dream', then every player (except the 'dreaming dragon') scores 2 points. If no player correctly guesses the 'dream', then every player (except the 'dreaming dragon') scores 2 points. If at least 1 player, but not all players, correctly guess the dream, then the 'dreaming dragon' and any player which correctly guessed scores 3 points. If a player guesses a card that is not the 'dream', then the player who put down that card scores 1 point. Once all points are scored, this ends the turn and the next player takes the role of the 'dreaming dragon'. In order to win Cards of the Dreaming Dragons, you will need to reach the end of the game board first. Each point you receive will allow you to move upward on the game board. You are represented by a cute dragon on the board as you move through this fantasy world until the end, trying to win and surpass the enemies.

And as you wander on your own journey, who are the strange, unworldly others who probe those questions as they pass like ghosts through your travels? Were they ever really real? Glitchhikers: The Spaces Between is about the thoughts that exist between destinations, the parts of journeys that dominate our time but not our attention, when our minds wander to parts of ourselves and our world normally left unexamined. On a late night highway drive, a quiet train car in the early hours, a walk through a moonlit park, or the endless wait in a deserted airport, we listen to weird music amid the ambient announcements of delays, and question our place in the universe. Inspired by long travel and the stream of consciousness it fosters, Glitchhikers asks you to look inward. Find the answers to your questions, and question the answers you receive. Ruminate on life, the universe, our place and purpose in it. Voyage through a freeform narrative experience, converse with the endless inevitability, and explore the cosmic, hopeful world you find yourself in. A follow up to the critically praised short game released in 2014, Glitchhikers: The Spaces Between is an expanded experience, reborn and reimagined. No pressure, no failure, no optimal path, no journey exactly the same. Glitchhikers: The Spaces Between is an introspective freeform game where the player picks a journey, slips into that liminal space and has a unique experience travelling into their own thoughts, guided by the characters they meet along the way. A late night drive, a deserted airport lounge, a moonlit walk through an empty park, a quiet carriage on an overnight train, a 24-hour convenience store. Never the ultimate destination, spending time in the inbetween creates a setting for contemplation and reflection, a mood that exists in these liminal spaces. The hikers you meet on each journey will travel with you for a time, offering thought-provoking conversations, and questioning your place in the universe. Who will you meet? What will you talk about? Were they real or just a figment of your imagination? An extensive original soundtrack full of chill grooves, upbeat wonder, dreamy synths controlled by your movement through space, and that one busker who makes you feel right at home: each journey has its own feel. Glitchhikers: The Spaces Between both expands and dives deeper into the ideas behind the original Glitchhikers (released as a short conceptual game in 2014), to fully realise the concepts and present a polished and fleshed out experience to a new generation of players. Silverstring Media are a vital and vibrant voice within narrative indie games, creating a string of short experimental titles and working as narrative guns for hire on indie darlings including Celeste, Crypt of the Necrodancer, Where the Water Tastes Like Wine, Manifold Garden and Wandersong.",48,623.52,34,640,19,True,2022

Therefore, both types of players are necessary for the internal economy of the virtual world of AO. When starting the game and creating a new character, the player chooses the class to which he wants to belong based on his preferences and game expectations. Players who prefer faster and more dynamic gameplay tend to prefer combat classes, while those who prefer a more complex experience rich in interactions and trades tend to choose one of the so-called secondary classes. Available classes: Wizard It is the class that is dedicated exclusively to the use of magic, they have a phenomenal amount of Mana (which allows them to cast a large number of spells), an acceptable magic attack but they have low life points and poor agility. Cleric A class that has its fair share of magic and physical attack, combining them can be quite effective, but it doesn't excel at anything special.

All characters depicted in-game are of age. Your isekai adventure starts after an extremely coincidental, not at all weird car accident. You wake up in another universe only to discover it’s being guarded by goddesses of desire. Now, these girls don’t have it easy, which is why they need you - the chosen one - as their Guardian. These lusty goddesses await your order and - conveniently enough - they crave your seed to give them power. So why do these powerful beings actually need your help? Well, long ago, the Sun and Moon goddesses coexisted peacefully, and together they guarded the lives of mortals. Taiyun, the Sun Goddess, warmed and nourished all life, winning the respect and love of mortals. The Moon Goddess Yue, who was envious of her sister, called forth terrifying Moon Devils to start a carnage. Mortals lived in fear during those dark days, with no hope in sight. Taiyun led mankind against demons in retribution. Sun and Moon collided in the Yin-Yang Ocean, creating the Swirl Abyss. Both sides lost. With her dying breath, Taiyun instructed humans to build a lighthouse tower and imprisoned the Moon Devils in the Swirl Abyss. Guardians were tasked with protecting humankind and defending the tower. This is where you come in, almighty Guardian! You’re already lost in an unknown world, surrounded by mystical anime beauties - might as well make the most out of it.

Your decisions will determine the ending of each adventure you take. Every story has different and random components. This means that the stories will vary from game to game. Even though HB&amp;P is an 80s/90s style game, we have taken the liberty of saving you from having to read the boring endless story paragraphs. Here is how we begin. You, the player, will generate a character from a series of available classes which enters a medieval fantasy world. During the initial launch of the game, six classes will be available: Warrior, Wizard, Rogue, Bard, Necromancer and Priest. In addition to this, there are two more classes that will be added in the future. This world is made up of stories. These stories are completely replayable, since they are based on player's decisions, their character, their skills and items. To add to this, all the stories have a procedural component that generates different places, encounters, characters, traps, combats or random loot, even if you replay the same story with the same character! Some stories may also change their storyline each time you play them again. You will not play two identical adventures. The adventures can be completed in the order you chose, and each time you play one of them you can choose between 6 different difficulty modes. You can adjust the difficulty of the game to your liking individually for each adventure. The character will earn experience points and be able to level up, so in the next adventure your character will be stronger. There is no proper level system and your character will improve the characteristics that you want, to the limit that you desire. This will allow you to configure your character to your liking. For example, it is possible to get a Warrior-Wizard if you manage to obtain enough value in a certain characteristic, and you find the appropriate spells or items.

50997,Reality Mixer - Mixed Reality for Vive and Index,2022-01-20,4.99,0,Reality Inside Ltd.,Reality Inside Ltd.,"Utilities,Early Access","Reality Mixer lets you bring real objects into VR. It uses the cameras on the headset to show a real object and its surroundings in the current VR environment. It can be used at the same time as other VR software and games. Think of objects like keyboard &amp; mouse, a racing wheel, a clock on the wall, a drink on your desk, a phone, a tablet, a chair, etc. Also larger real objects can be used. Like the door to your room, so you can see who comes in, or the couch with your friends. Bringing real objects into a virtual environment is known as ' Augmented Virtuality '. Reality Mixer creates 'boxes of reality' which are shown in VR. Apart from these camera boxes the app also provides a mixed reality Cockpit for use with simracing, a Floor Viewer to quickly see the real floor around your feet and a Lap Viewer for use with seated experiences such as Big Screen. Lap Viewer can be used for quick glances at a normal (untracked) keyboard on your lap. If you have a Vive or Tundra Tracker, you can attach a camera box to it so the tracked object will be visible wherever it is in your play area. The real objects (and their immediate surroundings) will not be visible all the time. There are three activation methods: Activate by Proximity : Objects (camera boxes) will fade out when you are too far away. This fade out distance can be set by yourself. Activate by Gaze Angle : Look straight at a camera box to make it visible. Use this activation method with seated games where you have things on a table next to your seat. The activation angle and optional activation delay can be configured. Using an activation delay means you have to look at the object for a second before it starts to show itself, to prevent accidental activation. Floor Viewer and Lap Viewer both use Gaze Angle Activation by default, but could use Proximity or ButtonPress activation as well. Activate by Button Press : Press a keyboard, mouse, gamepad, HOTAS or racing wheel button to turn on/off a camera box. When an object is not visible, it will not use any resources. If you have an Elgato Stream Deck , or if you use Touch Portal on your phone or tablet, you can use it in VR with Reality Mixer . Chroma keying (green screen) will make the background of the objects transparent so the VR world shows through. This can be useful for objects such as a racing wheel and HOTAS. (Chroma keying is in development. Please see the Early Access part above.) Instructions Start the app once from your Steam Library. It will auto-launch with SteamVR next time. Open the SteamVR dashboard. Click the icon for the Reality Mixer app. See image below. Follow instructions on screen. Compatibility Reality Mixer can be used on: Valve Index HTC Vive (the original Vive) HTC Vive Pro 1 HTC Vive Pro 2 The Vive Cosmos is currently not supported because third party apps don't have access to the cameras. This also applies to WMR and Oculus headsets. (This may change in future.)",22,109.78,16,710,0,True,2022

Set in the early months of the war, it tells the stories of civilians trapped on Russian-occupied territory. In their shoes, you will not be a fighter, only a survivor. The novels will take you from the first volleys of the war in Hostomel, to the terror in Bucha, to the defiant resistance in Mariupol. You will have to keep yourself and your loved ones safe, and eventually escape to safety. This will take courage and resourcefulness — and sometimes, sacrifices. Based on real events Every novel is a dramatization of eyewitness accounts and real events recorded in the area, condensed into one story. The gameplay is text-based and accompanied by music and illustrations. The game's art comes from authentic war photographs taken in the areas where the stories take place. Truly free — no catch The full game is completely free (no in-app purchases, etc) + a free Demo is available until the full game is released. We do not try to profit from this project. Our goal is to share the recent experiences of the people of Ukraine with a worldwide audience. Devs are from Ukraine Developed by a small team located in Kyiv, Ukraine, working from our office despite the wartime conditions. As a Ukraine-based company, we could not sit idly by as the war rages in our country, with enemy forces stopping 3 km short of Kyiv itself, and a large portion of Ukraine being occupied. One of the guys from our team was caught by the Russian invading forces in Bucha (where one of our stories takes place) and had to hide in a garage basement for a week with his family until they managed to evacuate. His house was plundered and looted by the Russians along with many other houses in the town. He told us his eyewitness account, which we used along with other public sources. A lot of our relatives' or friends' lives were also affected. Fortunately, everyone on our team survived so far, but the war continues… THREE STORIES The game includes three interactive novels about some of the first towns that were hit during the invasion: Hostomel, Bucha, and Mariupol. In each story you will play a civilian, completely outmatched against the invading Russians. Your only task is to keep yourself and your loved ones safe, and escape with your lives. But remember: as a civilian, you can only do so much. Hostomel Available in Free Demo On Feb 24, 2022 Ukrainians woke up to the sound of air raid sirens and rocket strikes. A massive Russian airborne attack upon the outskirts of Kyiv followed. The town of Hostomel was among the first targets. This is where it all began. As a retired aviation engineer, Oleksiy Borisov is not equipped to handle the challenges of the war. In this role, you will have to manage your survival resources, and take care of your group's emotional needs. It's not about winning the war — it's about seeing your loved ones to safety. Bucha Available in Full Game for free After a week of intense fighting, the North-Western outskirts of Kyiv fell to the Russians on Mar 5, 2022. Like many other small towns in the area, Bucha was under a month-long occupation. This occupation was among the most brutal in the history of warfare. Yarik Kravchenko and his sister Vika came to Bucha to wait out the assault on Kyiv, the capital of Ukraine. Their mother Yana is a medic defending the capital, while Yarik and Vika are stuck in Bucha, unable to escape on their own. And the occupation is becoming more brutal by the day. In this story, you will be the most vulnerable in the face of the war. You will face tough choices, and a happy outcome will not be assured. Mariupol Available in Full Game for free In the 8 years of the war, the city of Mariupol had already fallen under attack before. Back then it was over quickly. Now, it's about to become one of the biggest and bloodiest sieges of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Dima Kornienko is a talented surgeon and a native of Mariupol. When the war comes to his city once more, he finds himself on the frontline along with other medics. Your staff is well-trained and motivated, but the situation in the city is growing desperate, and supplies are quickly running out. In this story, hard choices will have to be made — choices nobody can make for you. To save as many as you can, you must keep track of your hospital's readiness and your own mental state. You'll help no one if the hospital collapses… or you do. Support the project! The project is fully free, so if you liked our free Demo, please, support us by pressing Add to your wishlist and Follow.

The culprit is a mysterious knight in black armour; the only clue left in his wake is a bag of gold coins minted with the profile of an unknown woman. Joining forces with the beautiful and enigmatic adventurer Switch, and the mischievous fairy Echo, our hero sets forth on a journey through the forgotten corners of his homeland in pursuit of the black knight and the sinister forces behind him. But on the way Otto will discover much more than he anticipated in this tale of romance, swashbuckling action, and adventure! FEATURES A concise, fully-realised visual novel inspired by genre classics 60,000 words clocking in at around 5-7 hours of reading De luxe hand-drawn character and background artwork Dozens of bespoke illustrations depicting key moments in the story A memorable original soundtrack that brings the adventure to life All for absolutely free! CHARACTERS After losing his parents to a plague, the disappearance of his older brother, and suffering an injury that left him hobbled, Otto feels as though the wheel of fortune has tossed him aside and left him to rot. When his sister, his sole remaining family, is inexplicably kidnapped, this retiring and passive youth decides he's lost quite enough and resolves to take his destiny into his own hands. From the scorching deserts of Casper comes this wily and free-spirited adventurer, hot on the trail of a series of kidnappings she's been tasked with investigating. When her path crosses with that of Otto's, the two team up in the spirit of mutual interest. But the appearance of such a stalwart ally seems almost too good to be true; just what other motivations does she harbour behind her lovely face and disarming smile? A certain incident in a magical forest thrusts the presence of this adorable, disagreeable creature into Otto and Switch's reluctant company. Living for thousands of years has granted Echo a wealth of knowledge and wisdom, but extracting anything of the sort past her dismissive and haughty personality may well prove to be an exercise in futility. Probably born to be a teacher, Otto's sister Bronwyn decided from an early age that her goal in life was to give every child in the isolated valley where the two siblings reside a proper education. Being kidnapped has thrown a considerable wrench into these plans, and being separated from her younger brother, the apple of her eye, has left the usually altruistic and patient young woman in a foul mood that she won't hesitate to visit upon her captors. A cruel and capable warlord from the harsh northern steppes. A successful military campaign has placed the land of Byron and its long-suffering people in the palm of her hand, but also left her unsatisfied, existentially bereft, and quickly sliding into indolence and hedonism. The stage is set for this slumbering beast to be roused from her stupor, but who can say whether good or ill will come of it?",0,0.0,0,391,10,True,2022

Quiplash 3 now has a Moderation feature that allows responses to be seen prior to being displayed on screen. Additionally, a new filtering option allows profanity and hateful speech to be blocked before even reaching moderation. So that’s it, right? Thank you for asking, but no! Quiplash 3 has a new final round called Thriplash, where the prompts ask players to enter three responses. That’s three times the chances to be funny!

The Steam edition comes with all new game modes and features to bring a fresh and challenging experience worthy of fans of the word game genre and newcomers alike. Game Play: Shuzzler involves spelling words according to criteria given by cards drawn from a deck. For example, a given card may require spelling words with exactly four letters, words that start with the letters 'SH-', or words for types of fruit, US states, or sports. Spell words with letter tiles in a grid by clicking the letter tiles individually or swiping them by click-and-dragging the mouse cursor to connect adjacent letter tiles. If you spell all of the words allotted for a card, you earn it and are awarded the card's point value in addition to the points you gained from spelling words. The objective is to earn all of the cards. Key Features: Unique game play Single-player and local PvP multiplayer or play against an AI opponent 32 fast-paced, timed levels available in single-player mode 200 unique cards and 60 category cards (e.g. colors, beverages, mammals, automobiles, etc.) featuring beautiful (mostly) original concept artwork Submit words using letter tiles in a grid by selecting tiles individually or swiping (i.e. click-and-dragging to connect adjacent tiles).

Either 2 or 3 cards are drawn at a time and are revealed in a stacked configuration (see graphic below). The top-most card must be earned before the underlying cards can be earned. Game Modes: In addition to solo play, the Steam version introduces quick play with two all new game modes, including Pass And Play mode that enables local multiplayer games for playing with friends and Versus AI mode that allows you to play against an AI opponent: Solo Play: Solo Play (i.e. single-player) offers 30 individually-crafted levels divided into 9 distinct categories: Food, Animal, Geography, English, Science, Home &amp; Living, Culture, Society, and Miscellaneous.

Goal: play, earn points, get high score, buy upgrades, repeat Opalescence: A chromatic effect, commonly found in opal, in which colors reflected off an object depend on viewing angle Opalescence is a colorful bullet-hell in which you collect points, fight enemies, and dodge to get a high score. Four Main Game Modes: Though it can change in some missions, the goal of the game is usually quite simple; Collect Points, And Survive. Points are the colorful small pellets that appear around the map. Getting a point changes your color and keeps your light from fading. Tutorial In this game mode, you will learn the basics of the game though a series of a few short missions. Standard In Standard, you try to consistently beat your best score with in the using the game's standard rule set. The challenge gets harder as you go. But with your laser, your cannon, and power-ups, you can probably survive... for a while. Get the highest score you can! Missions Much like the tutorial mode, in Missions, you have specific tasks to complete. This time, they will require much more quick-thinking, dexterity, and reaction time. Finish each mission with as many points as possible or in the shortest amount of time to get that high score! Challenge You pick and choose modifications to the standard rule-set to make the game harder (or easier). By making the game harder, you can increase how many points you can earn. How many lives you start with, how quickly your light fades, and how fast you move are all up to you in this mode! Entity Types: Player The colorful colorful crescent-shaped entity that you control. To defend yourself, you can shoot your canon (left-mouse-button or left-bumper on controller), shoot a laser (right-mouse-button, or right-bumper on controller), drop bombs, or you can simply dodge. Chaser The Chaser is the most common enemy type. They are the black triangles which follow you. If they touch you, you will explode. They come in different sizes, the smaller they are, the faster, but they will also have less health. Chasers have a pretty low amount of health, but if several corner you, things can get dicey. If you make a Chasers collide with another enemy type, they will damage and potentially kill it. Given their low health, making to Chasers collide almost always kills both of them Shooter The Shooter is the second most common enemy. They are diamond-shaped stationary enemies. Instead of moving, they launch missiles at you. The missiles just move in a straight line so they are pretty easy to dodge on their own. Just like chasers, missiles will damage other enemies they collide with. Eater The Eater looks like an eight-sided star largest of all enemy-types. Eaters are resilient enemies, having the highest health. On top of that, they are immune to the canon. Only lasers and bombs will kill them. Eaters aren't stationary like the Shooters, but also don't follow you like the Chasers, instead, they always move toward the closest point until they touch and destroy it. They repeat this until they are destroyed Controls: Both controller, and keyboard and mouse are supported. Action; Controls Moving Through UI Elements; WASD Keys, Arrow Keys, or left control stick, or Mouse.

These are called Power-Ups. They come in quite a few different flavors, and can be distinguished by their color and most have a icon on them. You collect them as you do points, (simply running into them). When you do collect a Power-up you will be granted a certain ability or have one of your stats changed in a positive way. Each power-up changes you in a unique way, and their effects are as follows: Power-Up Name; Effect Barrage; Makes you shoot your canon much faster, unleashing a barrage of pellets on your enemies Bombastic; Gives infinite bombs for a short period of time Bullet Time; Slows down time itself, but slows the player down less than everything else Gravity Well; Expands the gravity of the player, making it so that points and power-ups will be attracted from a much larger distance Incendiary; Makes the players canon shoot much larger, faster and more damaging pellets. Incendiary pellets can damage Eaters Max Bomb; Gives the player back all three bombs, and drops a giant bomb One Up; Gives the player a single extra life Opalescence; Makes you rapidly shift colors and become invincible. If you run into an enemy while Opalescent, all enemies will be destroyed Over Shield; Places an shield around the player. If you have the Over Shield, anything that would normally cause you to lose a life would instead simply break the shield Unmaker; Automatically charges and shoots a much more powerful and long-lasting version of your laser Vision; Greatly expands the light cast by the player, allowing you to the enemies in the majority of the world",0,0.0,0,513,0,True,2022

However, it's also very rewarding, and if you just keep at it, you really can learn the basics of how to fly a helicopter. THE SCENARIO: The National Laboratory has been studying all kinds of crazy biological 'tools', and now it's under invasion. If any of that research gets captured, or worse, some sort of vector gets out, it could be the start of a happy new world. For zombies. For us, it would be quite inconvenient. Perform aerial interdiction against the relentless Commies, using an increasingly sophisticated arsenal of weaponry from your Multi-Role Helicopter (MH), callsign Zombie 26. If zombies were to somehow result from your failure to fight off the invasion, and the zombies were to escape, all hope of containment would be lost, so fly like your life depends on it (SPOILER: It does). Two maps and game modes, and 31 achievements will keep you coming back to fly the most realistic arcade helicopter game on Steam. KNOWN ISSUES: Keyboard bindings are for English Language layout; some bindings will not work correctly with other-than English keyboard layouts. NOTE FROM THE DEVELOPER: As any honest Attack Pilot will tell you, probably less than 1% of the flying includes pulling triggers. 99% of the flying IRL is incredibly boring, and yet also incredibly stressful. If you're looking for the entire Attack Pilot experience, to include the aforementioned, this isn't the game you're looking for. Maybe get the AH-64D expansion for DCS World.

Together you hunt underground, demon-worshipping cults in a grimdark city. To defeat the cultists you will have to use your combat skills and supernatural abilities to stop them before they summon terrible creatures into our world. A challenging third-person combat game. Strong enemies and low health and resources can make it feel like the odds are against you.

Engaging Flow The combat is structured around rewarding those risk takers with good timing. Don't be shy! Find your opening and introduce them to your demon infested sword. There are very few defensive moves you can make, aside from dodging, so your best bet is trying to enter what we like to call, the flow.

Close the Distance Malia is out for blood, be best not to keep her waiting. Activate your warp attack and blink towards a cultist to land a quick strike with style.

In other words, be sure to finish the fights you start. Need a boost? Dodging will be your best bet at avoiding an attack. However, did you know that by timing your dodge right before the attack lands you can activate a perfect dodge? Doing so will light up your sword. Aside from making you look like a badass, during a limited amount of time any attacks you land on an enemy will gradually give you health. The best defense, has always been good offense.

But history would know him as the 'Dynast-King.' King Dorgalua strove to stamp out the hatred among the people of the isles, and for fully half a century, Valeria knew prosperity. Yet upon the king's death, civil war erupted anew as three factions vied for control: the Bakram, who comprised much of Valeria's nobility; the Galgastani, whose people made up the majority of the isles' population; and the Walister, who numbered but few. The isles were soon divided between the Bakram and Galgastani, and an uneasy peace settled across the land. Yet none believed the calm would last...

In this game, the players are the creators who are given the ability to create a 3D lady avatar. Each player can also create/record a unique story featuring the lady avatar in this virtual world. 1. Creation of a 3D Lover Players will first be taken to a virtual blue ocean called “Sea of Eva.” Here, the players will need to create a virtual 3D lady avatar, who will be created here can be highly realistic. Creating the lady avatar’s face for the first time is very simple. The player just needs to select from thousands of AI photos. All of them are over 18. Then, after creating a very realistic face via our AI technology, the player needs to create the lady’s hairstyle, and choose her hair color. Next, the system will generate a body for the lady avatar. Not in the dress preferred by the player? No worries, each player can choose clothes for the 3D lady avatar. Throughout the game, players can unlock more and more clothes by completing game tasks. The more tasks done, the more beautiful clothes can be collected for the lady avatar. 2. Artificial soul of the 3D lover as well as AI chatting accompany system Of course, in our opinion, the body alone is not enough to create a perfect 3D lover. The most interesting part of this game is that the created lady avatar can also have her personality and temperament. The personality created will affect the lady avatar’s attitude, speech, and action toward the player as well as her interactions with the player. The player can also give the virtual lady avatar a unique name, birthday, and personality, which can somewhat affect her speaking and behavioral habits. Okay, now let’s try to interact with the lady avatar. She will understand and reply. (Type in words here, or speak with a microphone.) Moreover, as the player’s interaction with the avatar is strengthened, her favorability system will also be affected. 3. Virtual dating system Thus, the next step is to allow this newborn virtual lady avatar to date. Players can also create a virtual home within the game. Unlike other games, the homes here look very realistic. Take a look at this example of a virtual home. In the virtual home, the game will arrange different interesting tasks. Once a player completes the task, awards can be gained (e.g., deeper favorability from the avatar), and more contents can be unlocked. 4. Dancing with her! This game provides users with interesting music dance gameplay. In the concert gameplay, we have a lot of rhythmic dances. Users can play different music by following beat timings and tapping keys. 5. Desktop MMD Mode 6. Brand new recording system The recording system allows players to plan, rehearse, and record all happy fantasies he would like to experience in the virtual game, just like a movie director. This is the operation button guide for this game. End notes In a science fiction novel entitled “Light of Other Days,” Bob Shaw imagined a kind of “slow glass,” which allows people to capture a picturesque scenery that they can later enjoy in their homes or workplaces, and shared a beautiful and moving story. My father often talked about “slow glass.” He said if it were in your windows, you could look out on your lawn and see something that happened in that same spot in the past. The outside of this window seems to show the beauty of the past. Birds fly in the sky, day and night alternate, and seasons change. A woman, her dress dazzlingly dazzling, she stood at the window for a few seconds, and then smiles. With this game, I would like to pay tribute to my deceased ex-girlfriend, Jessica, who died five years ago. My love for her is so deep, and even up to this day, I feel that everything in my life still has her traces. I miss her very much, so I have been thinking about developing such a game/program for several years now. This game serves as a “slow glass” through which we can re-capture and experience special moments with our loved ones. The beautiful woman is still there, as if she is still in full bloom only yesterday. Only the falling raindrops seem to tell the truth behind the withering flower. I hope that this game, just like Bob Shaw’s “slow glass,” can comfort the hearts of people like me throughout the world.",64,639.36,30,664,0,True,2022

This is not a metroidvania, it is a 'classicvania' inspired by Super Castlevania IV. In Balkadia your only weapon is the whip. It cuts through enemies like butter, uses them as throwable objects, can act as a shield and can shoot projectiles. Balkadia doesn’t have bottomless pits or one-hit death spikes, but will still test your platforming skills. Fluid jump controls, crouch movement and sprinting mechanics will help you overcome the challenge. In Balkadia you will stumble across many Slavic symbols and face off against famous monsters from Slavic mythology, including Leshy and Baba Yaga. An evil cult has kidnapped your son and intends to use him as a sacrifice to summon the most powerful Slavic creature in the world. You can speedrun the game in about 90 minutes, but it’s highly unlikely on your first play. There are 15 stages, each different in theme and design, and upgrades can be unlocked to help you with the finale. They can also be used to blast through previous stages for a bit fun, so there is replay value as well. Balkadia can work with any controller recognized by your operating system, but the keyboard is required during the initial configuration, hence why it states 'partial support' on the page. The menu contains a traditional configuration screen where individual inputs can be changed. Direct input is also supported. Every graphical asset in Balkadia is made with 4K in mind and is then scaled down for lower resolutions. The game also supports aspect ratios up to 32:9, so your ultrawide monitor will always be filled up. If you’re a retro gamer with a 5:4 monitor or an old-school 4:3 tube TV, you’ll be pleased to know that Balkadia is not locked to widescreen. At a really low retro resolution like 640x480, Balkadia will play mostly fine even on a single core CPU with 2GB of ram, but a dual-core is recommended to achieve stable 60fps ( Intel Core 2 Duo/AMD Athlon 64 X2 ). No, Balkadia has V-Sync permanently enabled and runs at the refresh rate of your operating system. If you have a 144hz display, but the game is playing at 60fps, you will need to exit Balkadia, change to 144hz in your OS settings and relaunch the game. Balkadia’s demo includes the first 3 stages. It’s best to just play it and see if you’re having fun. However, as the sole developer of the game, I can share some details so you can make an informed decision. Balkadia is an ambitious passion project, but not perfect. The gameplay is mainly inspired by “Super Castlevania IV”, the only Castlevania with 8-directional whipping. My goal was to bring this mechanic back and expand upon it. I am confident to say that this goal has been achieved. If you are a fan of SCV4, then Balkadia is for you. However, during testing, it has become clear that players unfamiliar with SCV4 have a hard time with the 8 directional whip - an essential part of 'supervania'. Balkadia is not as difficult as retro games of old, but still presents a challenge. If you take advantage of its controls, Balkadia becomes easier than SCV4. If you are uncertain, definitely try out the demo first, and bear in mind that if you don’t use the 8-directional whip, you won't fare well. In fact, this can make Balkadia feel more difficult than one of the hardest Vania games – CV3. Hopefully this helps you make an informed decision.",1,11.99,1,612,15,True,2022

Its citizens live their lives quietly. Or, at least, they once did. In recent days the speaker-gallows sprang, weedlike, in the heart of the town - and since its inception the denizens of Pareildas have been sacrificed, one by one. The electric words that spew from the gallows claim this is to staunch the blistering hatred of the vengeful sun... but the heat has only grown more and more unbearable. OUR PROTAGONISTS Anatoli works for the town train station. He dreams of leaving Pareildas, so that he might peacefully live out the rest of his life with his husband. His dreams share much in common with the blackened husks of the town's denizens that line the streets. Pyotr is an independent artist. He hopes, deeply, that he might do something to stop the hellfire slowly consuming Pareildas. But the price of stopping the natural order is immensely steep - and, of course, there's no guarantee this is a natural occurrence at all...

Water and food were burned out by the heated atmosphere, later it became possible to grow something only in underground plantations. Therefore, people began to fight for a place under the sun. Local conflicts grew into global ones. The population of the Earth began to decrease rapidly, so various countries built 'Super fortresses' - gigantic structures that penetrated deep into the earth. And in order to control the region, automatic turrets were placed that could autonomously carry out shifts even without people. In the end, the last global conflict with the use of nuclear weapons began, which led to the nuclear winter. This caused the planetary temperature to drop.

He’ll have to go to an all-girls school just to survive in this wacky comedy visual novel! FEATURES 20+ hours of story Two branching heroine routes Japanese voice acting SUMMARY The protagonist is left alone in the world after his grandmother passes away. He is found by a young lady of his age who runs a school for promising gentlewomen, and with nowhere else to go, he ends up in an otherwise all-female dormitory. However, his new housefellows are all absolutely eccentric. Weren’t they the ones who rescued him ? Now he doesn’t know who’s taking care of who...! CHARACTERS Kazari Saionji (Voice: Anzuhana) The daughter of wealthy business tycoons, she was actually raised by Minato’s late grandmother, who was her maid at the time. Out of love and a sense of filial obligation, she assumes responsibility for Minato’s living expenses after hearing about his plight. Thanks to her rich parents owning the entire campus, she happens to be the board chair of the same school she attends as a student—Whitebell Girls’ Academy—and so conveniently enrolls Minato there, too. Despite her attempts to come off as a refined, elegant young lady, in many ways she’s surprisingly clumsy and below average. As her roommate, Minato soon discovers that she’s not only slow and socially awkward, but gets lost easily and needs her hand held for the simplest of tasks... Yuzu Kifune (Voice: Akane Ueda) Minato and Kazari’s classmate and dormmate, and the head of the school’s newspaper club. Another daughter of a prominent family, but unlike Kazari, she’s genuinely charming, friendly, and almost too accommodating to Minato... That might make it sound like she’s the ultimate Japanese tradwife, but when it comes to domestic chores, she’s beyond salvation. She’s also a terminally curious and surprisingly stubborn tomboy who tends not to sweat the small stuff—to the point where her dorm room is a constant pigsty. And as if that weren’t enough, she’s actually confident(!) about her terrible cooking... How can a girl so good at everything else be this catastrophic when it comes to household affairs?! Hinata Ogaki (Voice: Airi Himekawa) Minato’s junior dormmate and a member of the library committee. Her family struck it big only recently and now controls an up-and-coming business enterprise. Despite being a “nouveau riche,” she has none of the usual smugness that comes with it. In fact, she’s too caught up in being a huge fantasy nerd and edgelord to really care about things like family standing or “having a decent personality” anyway... Speaking of edgy, she insists on calling herself “Zarathustra, General of the East.” Indeed, as one of the Demon Generals of the Four Heavenly Kings, she apparently already rules the world as we know it. Her story often changes, though, so sometimes she’s “about to invade” us in the near future, instead of already being in control. For all her constant cringiness, however, she’s actually not so bad underneath. Heck, she’ll even apologize if you tell her off hard enough, waterworks and all. Minato Asuka (Voice: Sara Ayumi) The protagonist of this game! Left without anyone to rely on after the passing of his grandmother, he was taken in by Kazari and offered a roof over his head, as well as enrollment at her family’s all-girls school. Despite very much being a boy, when dolled up in a skirt he can easily pass for the fairer sex—even without the extra padding. While this god-given talent might help him move through his new school life undetected, he’s still loathe to accept how good a girl he makes... His hobbies and talents include cooking, cleaning, laundry, and other household chores. In fact, upon moving into the girls’ dorms, he assumed all domestic chore duties himself because he couldn’t bear to see the mess his housemother-less dormmates had made. For his troubles he was later voted “no. 1 ideal housewife” in a campus newspaper club poll. Miyu Minami (Voice: Haruto Turuya) Sits next to Minato in class. Always cheerful and approachable, even towards people she’s only just met. She’s also thoughtful and considerate, easily getting along with most of her classmates. Close friends with Yuzu, who has also invited her to join the same newspaper club. Despite attending an expensive all-girls school, her family is not that well off and is struggling to pay her tuition. The plan was apparently to ensure that she’s raised with a little more class than they have been able to provide thus far... Unfortunately, though, her grades are at the bottom of the class, much to her parents’ dismay. Miyu, however, doesn’t seem too worried about it. Nanami Nanami (Voice: Rin Nanagase) Minato’s homeroom teacher and math instructor at Whitebell Girls’ Academy. Gets salty if you make jokes about her full name or age. Seems to have landed the unfortunate extra role of looking after Kazari. She’s even the overseer of Dorm II—Minato’s new home. It’s not like she wanted the extra responsibilities, however. She just found herself unable to leave the seemingly helpless board chair to her own devices... She has two go-to maxims: “I don’t wanna do work” and “Why do today what you can leave for tomorrow?” As a chronic slacker, she leaves all the housework chores, including looking after Kazari, to Minato once he moves in.",131,2618.69,51,374,0,True,2022

More features coming soon; currently records online and non-AI local versus matches only. MECHANICS Input Leniency Most fighting games require inputs such as quarter-circles to perform special and super attacks; however, MerFight allows simpler inputs such as forward + attack to work. Performing the more traditional input properly will reward players with a slight meter boost. The goal is to allow players who may struggle with these types of input to still have a level of success when playing MerFight and help them get into the game more quickly! Pop Cancels With this explosive mechanic, players can double-tap in any direction during most actions such as jumping, normal attacks, and special attacks, to cancel them, allowing them to extend combos or avoid getting punished after a traditionally unsafe attack. Pop Push and Pop Roll While blocking, players can press HP+HK to Pop Roll, allowing them to roll forward of the way and potentially punish their opponent’s offense. They can also press LP+LK to Pop Push, in which they can push opponents back, creating space between them and their opponent. Unique Meter Management In MerFight there are two types of energy that can be spent. The main energy meter allows players to perform super moves. When one bar of that meter is filled, that player earns a Pop. If the player has filled all 3 energy meters, they cannot earn anymore Pops, so they will need to spend their meter if they want to earn more Pops. STORY A Tail of Fish Out of Water, Terrestrially Retold In the earliest of days, the three ancients oversaw all life. The ancients, The Aquatic, The Terrestrial, and The Empyrean were each a transfiguration of 3 separate elements, holding the world in balance. One day, an ancient shark warrior manifested the Celestial Tide, an atmospheric pool of water, causing all those in the land and sky to perish.

64616,Glory to the Robots!,2022-12-16,5.99,0,Ilya873,Piece Of Voxel,"Indie,Simulation,Strategy","Year 2647. You are an aspiring Robot Glory businessman who has saved enough money to open his own robot development business. To do this, you have bought a suitable planet to build your own factory. But space is very harsh, it is inhabited by many pirates who plunder unprotected planets. For this reason, you will need to protect protect your base from regular pirate attacks with the help of military robots. And for the production of robots , you will need to buy planets with valuable resources on which mining robots will work. Why do you need to buy planets, you ask? Because this is the year 2647, not 3647, you don't have the technology to explore very distant planets, and all nearby planets have already sold out all the factions. Repair robots will be useful to maintain the efficiency of your plant. Without them, all your workshops will bend and safely self-destruct. It is the repairmen who build and maintain the condition of the workshops. You will regularly receive new tasks from which you can choose the right one for you. But I warn you, at the beginning of the game, it's better not to take on tasks right away, but first build the necessary workshops, assemble military robots, repairmen and miners, arrange the delivery of resources, and then follow the circumstances. I wish you success and become a millionaire! About the game: A game in the genre of management strategy. Here you can build your own factory for the production of robots, and on another planet, and extract resources and test robots on other different planets. There is no specific goal in the game, but to develop your factory (or base) you will be able to, only by completing various tasks, receiving money as a reward. How to play? Perhaps the game will cause some difficulties for an unprepared player, so in this tutorial I will try to clearly explain the essence of the game and explain the basics. The goal in the game is to produce more and more cool robots. And so, at the beginning of the game you will have a repair shop and one repairman (who is not attached to the repair shop so that you can always build workshops), as well as 1 drill that is not attached to any planet. According to the standard, the efficiency of repairmen, miners and the military is equal to one, which is very small. You can increase the efficiency of repairmen, miners and the military in the 'robots' tab, in the same section you can go to the assembly of robots for the task. Do not confuse the development of robots for tasks and for personal use, since in tasks you may be asked to assemble a military, miner or repairman. Therefore, for tasks, you click the 'Build for a task' button, and you assemble the rest for yourself. In the 'Maintenance' tab there are buildings that are necessary for the operability of your database. The assembly shop is an important component, without it you will not be able to assemble any robot. The repair shop increases the number of available repair robots that build workshops and repair them. If repairmen are not attached to the workshop, then over time it will collapse. The military workshop increases the number of military robots that are produced in the event of an attack on the base. Attacks on the base occur regularly every few days. The damage inflicted on pirates depends on the effectiveness of your military robots. The Components tab contains all the necessary workshops for the production of various components for assembling the robot. The most important of them are the case and processor, without them it is impossible to test or produce robots. Equally important are the means of transportation — wheels or limbs. The characteristics of the robot and the presence of certain components affect the success of testing. Each workshop can be improved by increasing the percentage of quality or by adding a conveyor (the conveyor increases the production speed). All workshops included in the production affect the final quality and production time of the robot. A workshop involved in production cannot be improved, destroyed, suspended. If you want the workshop not to participate in production, just suspend its operation before assembling the robot. If the workshop involved in the production is destroyed during the production of robots, then all production will be interrupted and you will have to start over. Also, all workshops regularly charge for maintenance, so the more workshops you have, the more you pay. In the Resources tab, you can configure resource extraction by selecting a mining planet, a mining location, and also buy more drills. You can earn money by completing tasks. In the 'Tasks' tab, you can select any one task. The difficulty of tasks increases with the level of your factory. At the beginning of the game, I advise you to first build the necessary workshops, assemble military robots, repairmen and miners and set up resource extraction, and then take on tasks. You can lose in one case — if you run out of money. The game is saved automatically. That's it. Good luck!",11,65.89,8,380,0,True,2022

Research : Better to have stronger weapons or faster production? Many fragile outposts or few defensible ones? Your research decisions should always adapt to your tactics. If you are too far behind technologically, you will be inevitable destroyed. Base building : Decide between strongly fortified bases or nomadic existence. Remember that a still standing target is an easy target to hit. Use the possibility to place your buildings freely in the world to occupy strategically useful points for you.

It is a story driven AVN complete with full 3D visuals where your choices matter, and includes some twists and turns you may not be expecting. Not all paths will lead to the kind of spicy content you may be expecting, but there will be plenty of chances for that as our protagonist searches for adventure to fill his last summer vacation with. In The Cabin, you begin your adventure as an 20 year old guy who's lamenting his last summer vacation before venturing into adulthood to start a career. Little does he know, when his plans get turned upside down and he finds himself out in the middle of the wilderness, this is likely to be more than he bargained for. Meet new characters, enkindle deeper relationships with existing characters, and most of all, keep them and yourself safe in this AVN where all choices matter. Episode 1 of The Cabin includes, but is not limited to: - Visiting various locales While there won't always be a choice of where you end up (especially in episode 1), we have a wide variety of different environments you will experience throughout the game, such as: relaxing at the nearby lake, visiting various stores and venues in town, or simply exploring the woods and finding hidden local gems. - Meeting 4 romanceable characters (With more to come!) We're taking more of a 'Quality over Quantity' approach to our characters, focusing on creating deeper more relatable personalities and quirks. No two characters should feel alike, and everyone will hopefully find someone, or a few someones to their liking. - 450+ HQ 3D rendered images These are just what are in the first episode, and we estimate each episode bringing an additional 300-500 renders, and more in the way of animations in the future. - Enjoy over 20,000 words of story Again, this is only the first episode, and future episodes should be of similar length. - Future episodes We estimate when the game is complete, it will be around 10-12 episodes. However as new scenes are created, and new branches emerge, this can be difficult to predict, and is subject to change. 10 episodes, around 4000-5000 renders and 200,000 words of story is likely to be the bare minimum. As this game is an adult visual novel, it includes 18+ sexual content. Though Episode 1 is a bit light as it introduces a lot of the characters, and brings the player into the game world, here is some of what you can expect to see as you continue to play, and more episodes are released: -Masturbation -Handjob -Blowjob -Vaginal sex -Anal sex -Exhibitionism -BDSM Please note, the vast majority of sexual content is avoidable, and interactions with the various characters are optional.",7,27.93,0,466,0,True,2022

She eschewed tradition and decided to train as a knight to help her people as directly as possible. Her first mission seems fairly straightforward, as an entire company of knights accompanies her, but things worsen when they get separated. She does a beautiful job of holding her own in their absence, but what can she do when the world seems to plot against her? A sudden cave-in sends her tumbling into a different part of Mt. Noble's cave system, and now she and an entire village of people are trapped underground with no way out. The only available path leads up through numerous increasingly dangerous floors. An exit must be found, for her sake as well as that of the villagers... Letina is a trained knight of Arclight, but her lack of field experience makes her as green as most cadets. You'll explore the cave system within Mt. Noble, finding valuable treasure along the way and fighting the many creatures inhabiting each floor... or avoiding them entirely if you feel confident in your combat prowess! Grow stronger with the help of the spirits who dwell in the mountain, unlock shortcuts, find secret passageways, and uncover the mysteries of Mt. Noble's ancient corridors. Luckily, you're not entirely on your own. An entire village of people was trapped underground by the same cave-in, and they're just as eager as you to find their way out before their food stores dwindle. Join the survey team and gain their trust by completing missions and rescuing anyone in danger. They'll help by rewarding you with useful items and even have your back when the time calls. Unfortunately, the caves and their monstrous inhabitants aren't your only obstacles. There's someone else trapped down here. Someone who's after your life. Who is she, and who sent her? More importantly, can she be reasoned with? Classic RPG Exploration and Combat Explore floor after floor of a seemingly endless cave system, facing newer and more powerful enemies with each level you discover. Use pickaxes and explosives to unearth hidden treasure rooms, return to the village to help its people and restock, and grow powerful enough to tackle the increasingly complex challenges ahead. A Living Hub While Letina prefers exploring alone, that doesn't mean she'll have to face the dangers of the caves on her own. An entire village of people are trying to find their way out. As the newest survey team member, they'll offer you items for purchase, helpful advice, and hints, and quests to complete to obtain special rewards and even more precious allies for the final showdown. Organic Skill Acquisition While some of Letina's skills are learned through combat experience, some have to be acquired through unique gear and the abilities they hide within. Equipping gear with a certain skill will allow you to use it immediately, but fight with it long enough and it'll be yours to keep. Some say the most powerful abilities come from mystical spirits, but they only award their gems to those able to best them, so brace yourself for a gauntlet of challenging optional bosses! Choices Matter A member of the survey team is in a pinch! Should you rescue them? Choose carefully because they might be gone forever if you don't. And while dead men tell no tales, a corpse is of little help to anyone. Similarly, be extra careful not to anger the wrong people in the village. The elder will be forced to banish you entirely if your crimes are too severe, leaving you without a safe haven to return to.",0,0.0,0,471,0,True,2022

You are a knight of King Arthur's Round Table practicing swordplay in preparation for a big tournament. The wizard Merlin was kind enough to conjure up a training course for you, right in King Arthur's throne room! Grab a sword and get to it. How many rounds of Merlin's parcour can you do? Gameplay Select competitive mode, grab a sword (or two!) and start hitting the training dummies Merlin has summoned for you. One hit and they fall over. Hit all the training dummies in the throne room to advance to the next round. But be careful not to run out of time! Each round Merlin is going to conjure up more and more training dummies. At the same time, you have less time to hit them all. Luckily you get a little bit of extra time from removing a training dummy. How many rounds can you last? Round Table also features two other game modes: arcade/casual and sandbox. There is no score counting or high score tracking in arcade/casual or sandbox game mode. Arcade/Casual Mode If you want to just enjoy the game world without a ticking clock, pick the casual mode. There is no time limit, and you can play for as many rounds as you like. Sandbox Mode In the sandbox game mode you can set your own challenge! You get most of the dials and gauges that we use to balance the competitive game mode. Make the game as easy or as difficult as you like! And if you find the right setting for your flow, share it with us on Discord! Detailed Game Mechanics Round Table is a level-based hack'n'slash with a time limit and a running high score. The levels are called 'rounds'. At the beginning of the round a set of enemies spawn. The enemies look like medieval training dummies made of straw, hooked up to a single wheel. The enemies spawn in random locations and move randomly. The enemies do no damage. One hit with a sword removes the training dummy from the round, and adds time to the round timer. The round ends once all the training dummies that spawned at the beginning of the round have been hit, or if the round timer runs out. If the round timer runs out, the game ends. If all the enemies are removed in time, the game moves on to the next round. In competitive mode, the first round has a 60 second timer and one enemy spawns. Each round, the round timer decreases by two seconds, and the number of spawned enemies increases by one. Each enemy hit increases the round timer by one second. This balancing is correct as of 1.52, but may change with patches and updates. In arcade/casual mode, there is no round timer, and no score. This is ideal for everyone who is new to VR and wants to have time to get to know the gameplay. In sandbox mode, there are sliders for round timer, round timer decrease, round timer enemy bonus and hitpower. Moving the sliders changes the values, allowing the player to set a custom difficulty level. The hitpower setting controls how much force of a sword swing is applied to the enemies, which in turn determines how far they fly as a response to the hit.",1,7.49,-1,576,0,True,2022

Your job in the Prologue of the game is to take a control of a shadow organization dead set on global domination via bribery, intimidation, seduction, and any means necessary. Inspired by old classics like Plague Inc. and modern gems like The Shrouded Isle, this is a challenging game where you infiltrate nations, discover their networks of power, and then reshape them to fit your agenda. The Shadow Government Simulator: Prologue is a turn-based strategy game. The Shadow Government Simulator: Prologue is a part of the full version of The Shadow Government Simulator and is completely free. The most important is that prologue allows you to get into the world of The Shadow Government Simulator so you will be fully ready before the final product release! Turn-based strategic infiltration Every action you take matters on a global scale. When you enter a new nation, you’ll be alone with just a headquarters at your disposal and minimal information. Slowly, you will send your tendrils throughout the region uncovering who are the influential and how much power they truly wield. You'll discover their traits and personalities, earning an understanding of their weaknesses and how to best convert them to your side. Infiltrate nations around the world! More importantly, you'll discover who they are connected to, and thus person by person, you shall take over the whole elite. Having a strong interconnected network is the key to success, but the bigger you get the more visible you are and this could lead to your demise. Manage your network, cut and create connections, to ensure you act from the shadows when the time is right. Evolve your organization The world will be difficult to conquer without growth and adaptation. As you capture new units, you can change their abilities, unlocking new traits and adapting to the necessities of the shadow war. Throughout your campaign for world domination, you'll be able to build your organization with unique traits. Tailor your society and its pawns to fit your grand plan. Conquer the world and you'll be able to unlock different factions such as the Masons and the Templars, with different strengths and weaknesses! Fight for global supremacy As your organization grows and becomes more visible on the global scale the challenges you face will increase. The world’s countries will unite against you and you will face off against rival organizations. Choose wisely which region to infiltrate first, as they will provide different bonuses, but also present different challenges. Each region will offer a distinct play experience with its procedurally generated networks. As time moves forward the regions will acquire unique modifiers to increase the difficulty and diversity of the maps you play on. It might well be worth the risk, however, as nations you take over become yours to command, unlocking new powerful abilities. Be it a person or a country, they shall all become like pawns before you!",0,0.0,0,480,0,True,2022

Each time we start a new game, zombies will be generated according to the difficulty degree, with different variety number, blood volume, speed and body mass index of anti attack ability, and randomly distributed throughout the scene. 3. At the same time, a certain number of items will be randomly generated in each building. These items include blood replenishment, ammunition, enhanced attack, special skills, etc., but the items will not be generated again and will be gone when they are used up. 4. Zombies will generate zombies again every ten minutes based on the remaining number of their respective varieties. For example, the remaining 15 zombies may become 30 in 10 minutes and 60 in 10 minutes. 5. A little challenging is that it takes time to find items, and it also takes time to find and kill zombies. Zombies need the help of skills and items when they have little time left. All these need a balanced strategy. 6. Item generation and zombie constitution and distribution may depend on luck. Items are randomly generated. If there are enough types and meet the needs, the challenge may be completed soon. 7.

' - SplatterCatGaming - --------------------------------- Missing a good old linear experience - that isn't repetitive - with a great storyline and innovative game mechanics? TimeMelters: Tome I - Witches and Pyres might be the game for you! You can start playing the Story Mode at 5pm (solo or with a friend) with some pizza and finish it around 3am, the perfect game night! And then there's another 10 hours of gameplay time with the Challenge Mode! Created by the co-designer of Sang-Froid: Tales of Werewolves , TimeMelters brings you to a mythical land of dreams and nightmares, where witch trials seem the only answer to the preternatural forces threatening the land. TimeMelters is a strategy-adventure game that features a unique game mechanic: Time Travel, which allows the players to go back in time and fight alongside themselves. You play as Teagan, a witch whose powers were just recently unleashed by an unwelcome guest. Now, you must venture forth in a desperate effort to cleanse the countryside from the seeping evil that is corrupting it. Something is rotten in the Kingdom of Hogendale. Creation is stricken. Trees and beasts sicken, wither and are reborn as shrieking, malevolent shades. The dead claw their way out of the poisoned earth to swarm mindlessly over the land. No living man or woman is safe from their dripping talons. Whole towns are brought to ruin. King Ionracas’ dream of a lasting Pax Hogendala vanishes in an unnatural whirl of blood and misery. It must be the Witches! Who else could be responsible for this chaos? The King decrees their death by fire. And thus — many an innocent woman is condemned to the sacred pyre.

Challenge Mode : Test your brain power with 40 mind bending, 4D thinking challenges! Skill Tree: Choose how your spells upgrade -- yielding ever more powerful magic and intricate build choices! Original Soundtrack: Sumptuous, expansive soundtrack filled with epic moments (and a few earworms)! Why make this game? First and foremost, we try to make games that we ourselves want to play. As we get older. we don't always have a lot of free time in the day, and might only have 30 minutes here and there to game. So we wanted to create something that gets you into the action quick. No constant updates, long load times, or insane menu management. This game is for someone that wants strategy and intense action right away, coupled with a perk system to mix it up and a great storyline. What to expect: We are a small team of 3 people and it's taken us 5 years to make this game. While we are experienced and passionate developers in our own right, please don't expect AAA graphics. What you can expect though is some never before seen game mechanics and innovative systems. Because what TimeMelters may lack in cutting edge graphics, it makes up for with its unique design and captivating storytelling! Anyway, we hope you'll love TimeMelters as much as we do!

An exciting third-person shooter where the player will have to use intelligence as well as the trigger finger. Multiple different types of enemies. Male and female protagonists. Original Punk, Ambient and Classical soundtrack. A story based on Sumarian Legends, The Book of Enoch and other Ancient writings. his story has no beginning and no end. In the past a race of Angels, on a distant world had reached the limit of their development, they had exhausted the natural resources of their planet and had faced stagnation and decline. With their eventual decline before them they built the ship known as the Sky Citadel, a mobile space city in which they could travel across the sea of stars to find new worlds, which they could exploit and dominate, enslaving any existing populations they might find. After travelling the vastness of space and time, they came upon the Earth. A planet rich in the minerals they needed for their technology. They found vast deposits of gold deep within the subterranean caverns, a valuable resource which they hoped would be a catalyst for a renaissance of their disintegrating culture. Upon the Earth they discovered many lifeforms all of which were far more primitive than themselves, lifeforms which they could, using their science and magic, change and modify to create slaves and playthings for their pleasure and use. They took their Angel essence and mixed it with the beasts of the grasslands to create docile and willing comfort males and females to satiate their lust. They mixed their essence with the apes to create the slaves to mine minerals they desired. They used their essence with the fishes of the oceans to create the builders of the great undersea city. They created a myriad of giants, dwarfs, fabulous beautiful creatures, monsters and abominations. These creations were later to be known as The Fae. In time when the Angels had taken vast amounts of gold from the Earth, they left to continue their odyssey of conquest and exploitation, leaving 199 Angels on Earth to oversee the planet’s domination. In time the Angel overseers came to feel love for their subjects, and began to breed with them, and eventually school them in the arts of warfare, science, architecture, medicine, and aesthetics. Within time, the overseers, freed their slaves, and adopted an egalitarian societal model. Eventually the former slaves and their former overseers built vast cities together creating a paradise upon the Earth. Eventually the Sky Citadel returned after a long and unsuccessful voyage. At this stage most of the technology of the Sky Citadel no longer functioned, and all the knowledge of the home planet was now lost in the mists of time. The Angels had decided that they would now have to establish a new home upon the Earth. However the inhabitants of the returning Sky Citadel were horrified to find that the 199 overseers had created a new society and had genetically intermixed themselves with the slave races. The action the Angels took was swift and brutal. Led by the first clone of the master, the Angel Champion, the angels attacked the fabulous city of Atlantis, capturing most of the overseers, crippling their wings, torturing them, and eventually imprisoning them in the caverns of Subterrania. They then moved the Sky Citadel closer to the Earth causing fluctuations in the weather, the result of which was a global flood that wiped out the civilisation of the Overseers. Very few of the Fae survived and those that did were forced to live hidden away and in secret. The Angels re-established the old order using a newly created slave race, part Angel, part ape, to develop the science and technologies, the Angels needed to repair and develop the Sky Citadel, which by this time was little more than a floating hulk, with most of the technology no longer functioning. The original science, technology and knowledge which had been behind the building of the Sky Citadel were by this time long forgotten and lost to time. The Angels were now relying on their slaves to eventually develop an advanced civilisation which the Angels would then take control of. In the meantime deep in the caverns of the Earth, the former overseers, and now Rebel Angels, along with a few of the Fae which had survived the flood had overthrown the guard race keeping them prisoner. All of the guards had renounced their allegiance to the Angels, and had joined the Rebels. The Rebel Angels had then begun building a huge city so that they and their allies could live in comfort and safety. As the Rebels had been the Scientists, Alchemists and Thinkers of the original Angel society they were able to utilise what resources they had at hand. There were many new discoveries one of these being Brimstone Fire, the sulphuric blue energy with which they could power and light their great city, and another being Vril, the energy source which when combined with Brimstone Fire and focused through different mineral lenses could produce a super energy. With the discovery of Vril work began on the Brimstone Ray, a canon so powerful it would be capable of neutralising all of the advanced technology on the Sky Citadel. There was however a problem for the Rebel Angels, the four gems, which were to form the lenses needed for the Vril accumulators, the essential energy focusing component of the Brimstone Ray, were located in the Rebellion friendly City of Sodom on the surface above, city which was under attack by the Angel Army. The Angels had sent agents into Sodom who had learned of the existence of the gems, but not the location. They had then used ‘Rain of Fire’, a primitive but effective technology, where Sulphur pellets were shot at a target from the Sky Citadel to destroy the city. Then as Sodom burned and it’s citizens were reduced to panic and madness, the Angel soldiers moved in searching for the gems. It is at this point a Rebel Angel foot soldier and a Dark Angel Resurrectionist managed to defeat hundreds of Angels and locate the gems before the Angels did, they then escaped the falling city of Sodom, travelled beneath the Dead Sea, across the Bridge of the Damned and entered the newly built Third City of Hell, where they took the gems to the Vril accumulators. Then they made their way to the mountains at the top of the World and fired the Brimstone Ray. The Sky Citadel was completely incapacitated by the blast leaving it a cratered rock floating in the Earth’s sky. Following this victory the Rebels began planning their final assault, However the Angel Empire was far from finished. In a secret location they had built a fabulous city, where they had managed to relocate some of their advanced weaponry, including a time-travelling device called ‘The Bell’, ‘The Bell’ had enabled the Angels to make contact with developing civilizations in the Earth’s future, and exchange ideas, weaponry and armour. In addition to their hidden city the Angels had also began creating a subterranean network of outposts and tunnels. This network had enabled them to wage war on the Rebel cities of Hell. In time, with the aid of re-converted Rebels, the Angels managed a major raid on the Third City of Hell, stealing away all of the Bloodfire and Brimstone weapons. They Also managed to take with them the recently developed Angelfire weapons. The Queen of the city is now in hiding, awaiting assistance. This raid gave the Angels a distinct technological over the Rebels, who now face total extermination. A team of elite Dark Angel Soldiers have already attempted to locate and destroy ‘The Bell’ in the hope of stopping the Angels from gaining further technology from future civilizations. The y managed to find the location of the hidden city, which they have reported back is a a cemetery which archives the ashes of all the dead Angels, in the hope of resurrecting them sometime in the days yet to come. The advance team also reported that although the angels have Brimstone and Bloodfire weapons they have yet to utilise them to their full potential. Also the Angels now have in addition to Archangels in their ranks several Valkyries who are stronger and able to fly somewhat despite the Earth’s strong gravity and the weight of their armour. The advance team also managed to report that they had located ‘The Bell’ and were about to attempt to destroy it However they were captured and now face torture and death in the Angel’s prison. The survival of the Rebel Angels now hangs in the balance. The Queen of the Third City of Hell needs to be saved, and the Angel occupation force defeated. Then the advance team needs to be rescued from the prison, so that they can report the location of the Angel City and The Bell. Then The Bell must be destroyed, at all costs.",0,0.0,0,491,0,True,2022

Features present on day 1 of Early Access Two factions with which to battle against one another, Hong and Scav Goldhorn Island, a 1v1 map to destroy at your leisure 18 unique units to unleash on your enemy No unit or building cap, produce as many as you want as long as you have the resources Skirmish and Multiplayer mode A community-driven approach to balance and gameplay changes A ton of bugs ;) Note that those are the current key features, and this will be updated with each major update to the game. For a better idea of our plans after launch, be sure to visit our Roadmap which will be linked in the future in the Early Access section. Revamping The Classics Gameplay is the very core of every game, and is especially important in a good RTS title, as such we want to get it absolutely right. With a focus toward base building and squad creation, we seek to introduce new elements to the formula such as combining units, managing their ammunition reserves and making sure to have them fallback to safe zones to resupply, while also making sure that defending players cannot simply turtle their way through a match. In addition, we want to make it a beautiful experience by introducing elements such as high resolution graphics, dynamic weather, night and heat vision, mist and even interactive grass that small units can go prone in to take the enemy by surprise! Living Locations Commanding Nations will offer multiple game modes and maps, with a focus on Twin Valley, a future large and interactive terrain with hidden pathways and resource points. Further, the maps will also sport city centers and urban terrain which may hide more than you bargained for! Civilians still inhabit these zones, and intense firefight might rally them against you! Rebellions will start to form and spread throughout the maps, fortifying buildings as well as pathways and shooting at any players seeking to break through.* Away from these centers, other elements will keep you on your toes. Birds nestled in trees might reveal your location to the enemy, or provide an early warning of incoming forces!* Sound is also important, with in the future units emitting distinctive noise and characteristic voice lines at the click of a button to let you instantly recognize the one you’ve selected, and whether it is engaging someone or on the move.* *All this and more is what we have planned for the future of Commanding Nations, made possible with your support and council. If you wish to know more please take a look at our Early Access section! The Story So Far Enter the world of tomorrow, where war has transformed from an atrocity to an industry. Private Military Contractors and unaccountable militaries have stepped in to fill the role of impotent governments, making conflicts a market with profit numbering in the billions, and giving rise to an intense rivalry between these forces in what is called the Hidden Conflict. Kept concealed from the world under the guise of terrorism and the activities of rogue states, battles are constantly fought to ensure military supremacy or simply the most profitable contract. Now at a critical point, heavier and more devastating weaponry is deployed worldwide, sparking the flames of war. Soon all will be revealed, be it through the efforts of a whistleblower...or nuclear fire. The Hidden Conflict’s Instigators Vying for control of Twin Valley will be three factions present at launch: Raven, The Scavenger Union and Hong Corp, each with their own distinct playstyle, units, abilities and tactics.

The figure creator allows you to build your custom figures out to your liking. The system is equipped to allow you to build a figure by morphing the head sculpt and adjusting the colors of the assets. You can also take this a step further by importing your own custom figure parts and custom textures. Use this to bring in your own head sculpts, body parts, and attires and simply disable the body parts you no longer want to see. Once created, these figures can be used in your scenes to pose to your delight. Prop Creator The Prop Creator is used to craft custom variations of built-in 3D models. Use this to create your own ring, printouts, stage elements, crowd panels and more. I wanted to give you a good amount of flexibility here thus, you can import your own images for many of the assets. Once created, these props can be placed around your setup to your heart’s desire. Instances of the props are all connected. Therefore, changing the designing on one will alter all instances in use!

8395,Clanfolk,2022-07-14,19.99,397,MinMax Games Ltd.,Hooded Horse,"Simulation,Strategy,Early Access","Clanfolk is a challenging medieval colony sim that takes you to the Scottish Highlands and pits you against nature itself. Starting with an empty plot of land and only your closest family, you will learn to survive as you establish your hearth and home, watch over your livestock, harvest your fields, and fight the bitter winter. Whether you grow your fledgling settlement into a bustling inn or a central trade hub, or you instead content yourself with building a prosperous and self-sufficient homestead or livestock ranch, everything rests in your hands - including the very lives of your clanfolk. Craft your family's story from start to finish across multiple generations, building a home from nothing, and leaving behind a legacy for generations to come. Create your precise lineage or choose from an existing clan, then take charge of a multi-generational family seeking to survive in the harsh Scottish Highlands. Your family members will get married, have children, grow old, and eventually pass away, leaving their contributions and struggles to be carried on by the next generation. Manage schedules to make sure everyone is well rested, well fed, and reasonably happy without risking your family's preparedness for when the harsh winter inevitably settles in. Morning rituals, socializing, and rest punctuate a day of chores: sowing seeds, tilling soil, fishing, hunting, crafting, and cooking. Every member of the family has their own traits, aspirations, dreams, and skills that help determine what they do best. They will care for themselves and for each other, and they will seek to better themselves over time. Your youngest family members are full of potential and learn from working alongside their elders - teach them to hunt, cook, clean, build, or farm, ensuring all the core survival skills are carried forward to the next generation when the elders must be put to rest. The warm summers give way to crisp fall nights and brutal winters before life and spring return to the highlands - your survival depends on your ability to plan ahead and adapt to the flow of the seasons. Each season presents its own challenges and opportunities - whether picking berries, trapping eels, hunting rabbit, or seeking out mushroom patches, you'll need to make the most of the opportunities of medieval life. Soil conditions change and a host of factors impact how well your crops grow. Till the soil, employ techniques like slash-and-burn farming, and train the right farmers to keep your clan fed. The environment presents constant challenges - your livestock, your wares, and your clanfolk themselves must be kept safe from heavy rain and sub-zero temperatures. Water left in the cold turns to ice that must be melted over a fire. Food soaked in the rain spoils quickly, though wet objects don't catch fire as easily. Farm animals without shelter can die of poor health, and unless your people are properly clothed in furs, they can freeze when not standing next to the warmth of a fire. Establish your homestead starting with nothing but the land around you. Build the knowledge of survival across generations - every collected branch, tree, stone, and reed unlocks new ideas and methods your clanfolk can use to improve their living conditions. From sleeping in the dirt under the night sky to constructing properly ventilated houses and barns made of brick and stone, you'll be unlocking new materials to use and items to craft every step of the way. Technological advances happen naturally over time as you work the raw materials the land gives you, spurring your clanfolk to the creation of new ideas and methods. Pottery, bricks, and tiles are only available after you first dig up clay. Manufacture of iron tools are the product of chipping away at the right mountains. Working with furs is the result of hunting and skinning animals at the butcher's block. Maintain complex and realistic production chains across the seasons, prioritizing tasks and setting crafting quotas and requirements. Balance the need for essentials and luxuries alike. Prepare yourself for inevitable disasters – poor health, harsh weather, and raging fires can turn a thriving homestead into a graveyard or a funeral pyre. Your clan is not the only family in the highlands - traders, travelers, and neighbors seeking work will visit, giving you an opportunity to make new friends, earn coin, or grow your settlement. Trading posts attract members of other clans peddling useful goods and seeking to purchase your wares for themselves. Your reputation with another clan determines the types of goods their traders bring, and with each clan specializing in their own products, the right friends can ensure your survival. Travelers seek lodging as they pass by your homestead, and if you so choose you can provide them shelter. Particularly happy guests might extend their stay or pay good coin, and building a bustling inn can be an attractive possibility. Workers from other clans will arrive at job boards from time to time seeking an opportunity to earn money in exchange for their labor. A few extra skilled hands can go a long way towards finishing the harvest, bolstering your hunting parties, or staffing your newly built inn. Clanfolk is a game about life and family.

I’m going to climb this beanstalk and I will find the magic castle in the clouds and I will find the golden goose and then we will be rich and then you will have to apologize to me for being mad at me!” So now you will have to climb the beanstalk in order to beat the sh… in order to save your little brother before he falls down and breaks his neck. Gameplay: Your goal in this 3D platformer is to climb to the top of the beanstalk. Jump from stalk to leaf, from leaf to stalk, grab onto sprouts, ride the cloud and hope you don't make a mistake.

You jump into the role of a little paper plane that is supposed to rescue the world from little but evil balloon demons by dashing through them. Fast, relaxed, chaotic - You are free to enjoy the game any way you see fit as the only enemies of the game are balloons which generally are not well known for being too dangerous. The movement is fast but the world itself is somewhat peaceful. This enables you to lean back and enjoy the different levels and the sensation of flying. It is an excellent game for relaxing and blowing off some steam after an exhausting day of hassle. The game also features: • 12 different levels • Juicy balloon destruction and exciting dashes • A dash meter that needs to be utilized to save the world • Beautiful visuals and soundtrack • The experience of flying as a paper plane • Intuitive and relaxing gameplay • A moment of inner peace and happiness popping balloons and little balloon demons • A game that is enjoyable but doesn’t take itself too series – lean back and have fun Gameplay Description You start as a tiny paper plane in a giant world. You move continuously forward and are free to fly wherever you want. After you have played around a little and enjoyed the sensation of flying as well as explored the giant environments for the first time you start to discover nearby areas and hidden secrets. Very soon you will find many normal balloons and a whole bunch of huge demon balloons floating around in the environment. The normal balloons are soft and you can easily pop them by simply flying through them. The huge demon balloons on the other hand are somewhat hard and you are unable to destroy them by simply hitting them with your paper plane. Soon you will figure out that there is a solution to the problem. Whenever you pop a small balloon, you receive a little bit of dash power which enables your paper plane to become faster and perform a powerful dash. Using the dash, you are able to pop even the strongest of all balloons and therefore defeat the evil demon balloons. Now everything is a matter of exploration as you need to find all of the demon balloons while keeping an eye on your dash meter. Once you have destroyed all demon balloons in a level, a second wave of them will spawn and later a third wave. Every level is structured in 3 waves and once you have finished all of them you will be able to enter the next level and explore more of the giant world with your small paper plane. While the fast movement and the dashing add a somewhat fast-pace game play to the mix, the overall game is still pretty relaxing as after all your enemies are balloons and do very little to defeat themselves from your attacks. It’s a unique mix of exploration, relaxation and a minimalistic balloon combat system that brings fun without the need of too much thinking or strategizing.",11,87.89,11,478,12,True,2022

Muda (無駄) is the Japanese word for meaningless activity. It is defined as '...any human activity that consumes resources but produces no value.' - Wallace J. Hopp In this game, MUDA is represented by the little colorful monsters that sit in the factory and do unproductive nonsense. Productivity is represented by clever squirrels 'Tuwas' (German for 'DoSomething'). They are always productive and always work hard. The more efficiently the operation is managed, the more Tuwas work in the hall. With bad management, MUDAs are everywhere and waste valuable working time. Other companies send you inquiries for which you calculate offers with a suitable price. Always remember to stay profitable. Some of the inquiries are initially not lucrative and would be a financial loss for you. So go to your office to negotiate directly with the customer and secure a profit for yourself. If the companies accept your offers, the planning of the production begins. Strategically distribute the orders to your machines. With clever planning, you can process many orders at the same time and still on schedule. If your financial resources allow, you can rent more machines, which will make it easier for you to distribute the work in the short term. However, more machines cost more money and require more employees, which leads to higher expenses. If, on the other hand, you plan cleverly, a few machines are sufficient to meet the delivery dates. If you do not meet a delivery date, the customer is not willing to pay the full price, which has a negative effect on your sales and thus also on your profit. All machines must be serviced regularly, which inevitably causes downtime. If the maintenance of a machine is not carried out regularly, this can lead to defects. Repairing a defect always takes longer than maintenance. It is therefore worth scheduling maintenance. All of these factors above must be carefully considered when planning business operations so that your company does not go bankrupt. Can you still remain profitable despite the many orders and the higher turnover? Unlock the infoBoard planning board, which can help you with planning through automation. This gives you a constant overview of your machines, employees and orders. Backward scheduling means that you always meet your delivery dates and get the agreed price. infoBoard planning board helps you to reduce the costs of your company and thereby increase profits.",0,0.0,0,643,0,True,2022

Is this a multiplayer game? NO！ This is the most difficult game in history!!! The difficulty of getting started is Epic!!! Enter the game and send only one hero Only one hero? NO！ There are many heroes!!! You may not know the hero who can switch on the hero interface! Entering the battle, you may think you can only turn the box and walk around, I'm even racking my brains to figure out what you're going to do, How to turn the box around and what tricks can be turned out NO！ You don't need to study!!! You just need to run around!!! Then you find that you accidentally ignited a few squares. Oh, so this is an elimination game! NO！ This is not an elimination game!!! This is a war game!!! At this time, you find one or three guys with red blood on their heads running around opposite, And it's unrestricted running all over the map. Are you ignorant? Is the battle just running around and running around? YES！ Because there is an enemy, isn't a multiplayer game? Did you find that the color of the lit box opposite is completely different from the one you lit? By the way, the box you lit is yellow, and the box lit by the other party is red Then you stand on each other's box curiously, Bang, you're blown up!!! Yes, the box you light won't kill yourself, but the box lit by the other party will kill you! If you are sprayed by the flame of box explosion, you will also be sprayed to death! You run around and hide from each other's exploding squares. Never step on them or be sprayed by flames, Then you work hard to light a pile of connected squares and wait for them to explode, Poof, the other party turns over the same box, and all the boxs turn red!!! They're grabbing your diamonds!!!!! You learned to grab each other's diamonds, Then the box exploded, gained experience and soon rose to level 3, You can decide whether to upgrade each of the three skills by one level or how to add points. It's up to you What, skills? Why are there skills? You try to throw a skill out,, WTF！ The original skill can also lit the box! Oh, there are three skills. You tried to order the other two skills WTF, how come the other two skills are thrown out and the box doesn't respond at all? You lost the wrong object. You should lose it to the enemy hero! When the opponent's hero is standing on the square lit by you, or very close, you can use the control skill to control the opponent, and then wait for the square to explode Bang, you blew up the enemy! Ha ha, do you already know that this is a war game at this time? Does it smell inside? YES！ This is an extremely fierce game [/] We have designed many heroes and skills (although only 6 are released now) Each hero has different characteristics, Some are good at lighting blocks Some are good at killing enemies Some are good at assisting teammates ，，，， Heroes can fight alone, but they pay more attention to mutual cooperation, For example: -The master, Pascal, 1 skill and 3 skill moves are all ignited. After the big move is full, it can even reach an amazing range of 5 * 5, which is more suitable to ignite dice than other heroes. Moreover, these two heroes have thick blood and can be used as defensive heroes to ignite dice and recharge at the charging point -Vulcan's young son and mechanical puppet, these two heroes don't have large-scale ignition skills, and the most important thing is to have detonation skills. You know, the killing method of this game is to generate damage by explosion, which is very direct. They can be killed by instant detonation. The positioning of these two heroes is very clear, that is to do the work of assassins. In addition, the big move of Vulcan's young son is the fire wheel, It can directly and instantly detonate unlit dice. It can be said to be a big killer,,, -Cannibal flower and bear mushroom fairy, these two heroes are basically control skills. Cannibal flower has two dizzy skills. If CD is fast enough, it can dizzy the enemy to death. The disadvantage of this hero is that it is not aggressive and ignitable enough, so it can only do some auxiliary work; Immortal bear mainly relies on skill 1 to flash. The other two skills are relatively useless. The skill level is raised to level 4. He constantly flashes around the whole map and brings dizziness. Gank finally flips dice to light a pile and snatches it as soon as he flashes. He also stuns himself. He can't move. You really wants to strangle it,,, How difficult it is to start, how fun it is.

59940,SGS Operation Downfall,2022-08-09,14.99,0,Strategy Game Studio,Avalon Digital,Strategy,"Operation Downfall We are all aware that the atomic bombings of August 1945 on Hiroshima and Nagasaki precipitated the Japanese surrender at the end of World Ward II. But what would have happened if the Manhattan Project has failed or known such delays that the bombs could not be made ready in time? Operation Downfall was the codename for the Allied plan of invasion of the Japanese home islands. The operation had two parts: Operation Olympic and Operation Coronet. Set to begin in November 1945, Operation Olympic was intended to capture the southern third of the southernmost main Japanese island, Kyūshū, with the recently captured island of Okinawa to be used as a staging area. In early 1946 would follow Operation Coronet, the planned invasion of the Kantō Plain, near Tokyo, on the main Japanese island of Honshu. Airbases on Kyūshū captured in Operation Olympic, and possibly other captures on nearby Shikoku, would allow land-based air support for Operation Coronet. If Downfall had taken place, it would have been the largest amphibious operation in history. Japan's geography made this invasion plan quite obvious to the Japanese as well; they were able to accurately predict the Allied invasion plans and thus adjust their defensive plan, Operation Ketsugō, accordingly. The Japanese planned an all-out defense of Kyūshū, with little left in reserve for any subsequent defense operations. Casualty predictions varied widely, but were extremely high. Depending on the degree to which Japanese civilians would have resisted the invasion, estimates ran up into the millions for Allied casualties In this game you will be able to experience the two landing and the overall amphibious assault against the Japanese home islands in 1945 and 1946. The game scale is at division level for land units, wings for air units. Naval forces are abstracted and other special weapons such as Kamikaze or Midget submarines represented by events or the play of combat cards. Each region is about 100 square miles, and a turn represents 1 week of real time. Scenarios vary in length, for 10 to 27 turns. They will offer you various starting options (more troops, more replacements, more air support, different at start positions, airborne operations) that may alter the historical setup and offer vast replayability potential. Soviet intervention in the operation, as planned against the northern island of Hokkaido is also included. And Japanese domestic politics, as well as the role of the Emperor and its protection from capture are also considered. The Japanese have very few mobile troops, armor, artillery and their planes are numerous but outmatched. But they have very strong fixed defenses, well organized and incredibly tough to break, as they account always for the difficult nature of the various terrains of the Japanese islands. They can count also on the loyalty and dedication of their population. Their playing cards and events reflect this, plus the fierce nature of their defense. The Allied forces are well equipped, backed by a strong air force and impressive naval gunfire support, but their timeline and objectives are always very tight to meet, and in particular the need to secure harbors for supplies and airbases to ensure redeployment of tactical air support, all during a rather inauspicious time of the year and poor weather prospects. Those external constraints, but also various other assets, are covered by the diversity of the cards they have in hands. There were dozens of estimates on how the operation would unfold if it had been undertaken. All concur on Japanese stiff resistance and a huge level of casualties never seen before, a prospect that was potentially raising hell also at home on the US political front. Opposition between the Navy and the Army in the US was tense on the different aspects of the plan, as well as the means and weapons to be used. Another similar fierce fight existed inside the Japanese power circles between the proponents of the so-called Peace Faction and their adversaries willing to fight till the last of the millions of subjects of the Emperor. That battle would have been gigantic and of never-seen before proportions, no doubt! Would you like to try and explore the fight with SGS Operation Downfall? Estimated Playtime : 20h00+.

Theocracy is a classic 4X, turn-based, single-player, strategy game . As you lead your theocratic empire to world domination, strategic usage of peaceful radiation of divine power, decisive military campaigns and wise invoking of miracles, are all necessary elements of expansion and victory. Might and myth Recruit armies and command them across the world. Explore the terra incognita , peacefully convert pagans and enemy regions by divine power, or conquer them by brute force. Manage and improve your regions, construct fortifications and shrines in strategic locations, discover new knowledge and advance. Oh, and thou shalt enact dogmas and cast miracles! Do rely on miracles Things not going well? Summon monsters and holy men, or thunder-strike an approaching army. Punish sinners by volcanic eruption, or amaze them by solar eclipse. Game too long? Trigger the Apocalypse, now! Or later. Just watch out for those formidable heretics, atheists and aliens! Indie &amp; old-school Truly independent, home-made strategy game for fans of good old PC games. Call it retro, if you will. Designed, developed and crafted completely by one person. This is a game like your grandma used to make 'em: cute 2D graphics and slow-paced gameplay, which exercises your brain rather than your thumbs. Oh mighty and pious leader, lead your faithful people to glory and subdue the foes. Game concept Theocracy is a turn-based strategy game. Players take turns to move their armies, attack the enemies, cast miracles, choose research, decide what to produce in their regions and enact dogmas (commandments). Your goal is to expand your theocracy into a dominant world empire by defeating your opponents. This is achieved by conquest and peaceful conversion of other regions on the map and their incorporation into your own theocracy, and by disruptive divine interventions, which you can trigger - miracles and dogmas. At the beginning of the game, the ancient, undiscovered world is filled with pagan regions. You and your AI opponents - leaders of other theocracies - all start with one region (the Holy Land ), and from there you explore the world, expand your empires and try to defeat each other. Regions can be conquered by armies, or peacefully converted by impact of Power . Power is a special resource, which radiates from your regions, shrines, holy men and miracles, and impacts its wide surroundings. Power is used to convert tiles and other regions, and as it accumulates, it is used to enact dogmas and cast miracles. Important achievements in the game are rewarded by Victory Points . The first player to reach 100 Victory Points wins . Victory Points are awarded for percentage of world population following your religion, for number of other players' Holy Lands which you conquered, for enacting the dogmas, creating holy men, discovering sacred mountains and (should it be necessary) invoking the Apocalypse miracle. This is a humble, indie game, made byte by byte, pixel by pixel, from scratch, without any game engine. The game is done in retro, vintage style, with top-down 2D world based on classical antique maps. The game avoids tiring complexity and micro-management of dozens of features typical for its larger 4X cousins, and focuses on the action - why waste time building roads and farms, when you can just flood the enemy region?!?

Rogue Dungeon is hard and you will DIE! However, experience and skillful play will ensure that veteran Rogues will make it out of the dungeon alive. That's more than you will. You, you're going to end up in a Goblin's belly. Prove us wrong! Pick your Rogue, grab your starting loot, grab your skills, set your starting stats and enter the dungeon. Choose which room to navigate to via the mini maps. Rooms are divided into the following types.... Traders - Offer you a choice to trade loot or stats for other loot, stats, or henchmen. Some trades involve a stat test or the luck of a die. Loot traders typically trade two items for any one item they offer for trade. They make exceptions for the shiny stuff and will trade any item for a single treasure. Combat - Most combat rooms draw 1 to 3 monsters from the monster deck equal to the dungeon level. Combat is resolved using your Rogues primary stat and a D10. If the two combined are greater than the monsters combat stat, your Rogue hits the monster. If it's less, the monster hits your Rogue. If equal, both are hit. Damage can be negated by discarding an armor or by playing a skill or magical item. Potions and food can be consumed at any time to increase your health and prevent your death. Some monsters have a weakness to specific thematic loot and are vanquished immediately such as when the Medusa gets a look at her face in the mirror's reflection. Once a monster's health reaches zero, the monster dies and you receive one loot and XP equal to the dungeon level. Traps - traps litter the dungeon but most can be disarmed or bypassed if you have the appropriate equipment. Even if the gremlins ran off with your rope, there is always a chance you can come out unscathed if you pass an appropriate Strength, Agility or Intelligence test. If successful, tests result in an XP reward and avoiding any potential damage. All rolls maybe manipulated with the use of the luck stat. Spending one luck will allow you to modify a die result by 1 up or down, or allow for a complete reroll. Play progresses through 5 dungeon levels separated by a staircase. You may camp at the stairs without the threat of a wandering monster interrupting your siesta. You may level your Rogue at anytime so long as you have the XP. When you get to the final room, draw a boss monster and fight. Many monsters have special abilities activated depending on your attack roll.

Rootkits must collaborate with your operating system in someway to do something useful. They come with a driver file that you might see. Also rootkits are old threats.

I got an error. What can I do? Please check if there is a file named 'detective_bit_bytes_service_log.txt' or 'detective_bit_bytes_log.txt' in the installation folder. If you find one of them, send it to the support address or the community room. Do the log files keep the content of files? No. they just keep metadata for comparison. Their disk size usage is also quite low because of this reason. Logging a whole partition that has 700.000 files takes only 10 megabytes. Can I move my log files? Yes. You can find the 'LogData' folder in the installation folder. But the log files' hashes must be the same to compare. Hash is generated from monitored and excluded paths. If you monitored different paths, you can't compare them. You can use these file creatively. You can get a log from a clean Windows installed computer and compare with the other PCs, etc. Can I use Steam cloud? No. Steam cloud is disabled for this product.

After the ending, a special stage will be opened. How to play Clear the stage by eating up the cabbage! Make sure to eat all of the cabbage on the stage. This is an action game in which you control a pig and compete with the number and speed of cabbages you eat on the stage.

Afterward, you'll need to wait a while to use it again. If the pig is caught by a human, the game is over. Eating grass makes the pig stronger and allows it to eat more cabbage in one bite. The 'POWER' displayed at the top of the screen is the pig's ability to eat things. Mysterious berries that appear from flowers will power up the pig for a certain period of time when used. If you bite into the cabbage during that time, you can eat it many times faster. It is efficient to use three strong berries at the same time and eat them on the cabbage. If you collect 6 coins, the pig will become invincible. While invincible, the game is not over even if the pig is caught by a human. The speed of eating cabbage will be doubled. Infinite Mode, a gem will appear when you eat up all the cabbage. Collecting the gems will give you bonus items. Choose the most advantageous item depending on the situation.

Functionality with other VR headsets cannot be guaranteed. Stalk and hunt North America’s most iconic game species in virtual reality through woodland, prairie, and lakeside vistas. Approach as close as you dare to line up the perfect shot on a trophy buck, and experience the fear of becoming the hunted as dangerous predators turn the tables on unwary hunters. Utilize three distinct weapons with unique hunting styles as you aim from afar with a rifle, from close range with your shotgun, or make a precision strike with the bow! After a successful hunt, harvest your trophy and mount it in your trophy lodge with a variety of dynamic poses, capturing the tranquility or ferocity of a given creature. Horned and Antlered animals feature dynamic racks that ensure each hunt leads to a different prize. Will you find a small horned target, or a mighty trophy specimen? Even for creatures without such obvious display features, animals will also vary in size, giving fearsome predators a chance at becoming impressive collections to your lodge. Your targets include: American Bison The largest land mammal native to North America, in size alone this creature makes an excellent trophy, but this creature also has Dynamic Horn size as well, so hunters may wish to focus on getting not just large body size, but large horns as well! This species can be dangerous if provoked, so caution is advised. Bighorn Sheep A thick-bodied mountain sheep, with impressive winding horns. This species has Dynamic Horns, and hunters should focus not just on the length of the horn, but the curl as well. This creature does not present danger to the hunter, but care must be taken for good shot placement. Rocky Mountain Elk With elegant and iconic antlers, and being one of the world’s largest deer species, the elk is undoubtedly the crown jewel of many hunters’ trophy lodges, and fittingly has Dynamic Antlers as well. Elk naturally exist with a wide variety of body sizes, and hunters may wish to focus on trophies on both ends the spectrum. Moose The world’s largest deer species, and often considered the most dangerous of North America’s game animals, the moose is a challenging but incredibly rewarding prey species to tackle. Found alone or in pairs, the moose is more elusive than other game species, but can turn aggressive in an instant if threatened, making caution important when at close range. Fitting of a creature with impressive palmate antlers, this animal has Dynamic Antlers. Mule Deer One of the continent’s most widespread and commonly hunted species, don’t let that make this creature seem any less enticing. With Dynamic Antlers and a swift escape at the first sign of danger, this animal is best downed in a single shot even more so than your other hunting targets, for if it escapes you might never see it again. Feral Hog A nuisance throughout the country, hunting this animal is often seen as an ecological service. Crosses of escaped farm pigs with wild stock, or even simply loosed boars themselves, these animals breed a masse and dominate ecosystems they colonize. Despite this, they can make for impressive trophies with their Dynamic Tusks, and they come in a great variety of body sizes as well, ranging from smaller, natural sizes to monstrous creatures taking on their domestic proportions. Don’t be fooled, these animals can be dangerous when provoked, so make shot placement well. Grizzly Bear When it comes to ferocity and terror, few animals have the iconic American Grizzly Bear beat. Solitary by nature, the Grizzly can be trickier to approach than other animals, and when threatened becomes extremely aggressive. If not subdued quickly, this animal is very likely to down a would-be hunter. The ultimate trophy of a large individual can reach 9 feet or more when rearing up, making it a perfect addition to any hunter’s collection. Cougar One of the most widespread of the cat family, ranging from Canadian snowscapes, to temperate woodlands, down to arid desert and tropical rainforest, and even to the swamps of Florida, the accomplishments of this predator are clear to see. It may lack the size of the Grizzly, but more than makes up for it in stealth and speed. A deadly prey species, this animal will likely only give a single chance to take it down before it turns the hunter into the hunted.

The strategic layer is a 20 X 30 grid of sectors which creates 600 sectors in all. You move your ships around trying to protect your home planet and space stations from the invading fleets of UFO ships. You are also trying to collect resources from asteroid fields, nebulas and crystalline planets, and collecting ships modules at certain planets. Use these modules to increase your ships stats. The Invasion The space around your planet is being invaded by vast hordes of alien UFO fleets. You must protect your planet at any cost as losing it will end the game. You also have 4 space stations scattered around your quadrant of space. Try to hold on to these space stations as they serve as a great place to repair your ships, and they greatly add to your score. Your Ships You are not left defenseless as you will start the game with 5 ships, one at each of the 4 space stations and one at your home planet. You can build more ships by collecting metals. You can collect modules from most types of planets, and you use these to upgrade the stats of your ships. There are 9 different types of modules with 3 levels of each of them. Resources The game only contains 3 types of resources, metal, science and crystals. Metals are used to build new ships and to create repair kits for your ships. Science is used mostly for researching new technologies. Crystals are used for installing modules onto your ships. You can collect metals by searching asteroid fields. Science and be found by searching nebulas and crystals are found on crystalline planets. Technology As you collect science from nebulas, you use them to research technologies that will greatly improve your chances to hold off the invading fleets a bit longer. These technologies will increase your repair rates and reduce the time it takes you to move and search areas. Alien UFO Fleets Early in the game the size of the alien fleets will be 3-4 ships, and they will just be scout ships. These are the slowest and weakest of the 5 alien UFO ship types. But as the game progresses the fleet size will grow as will the types of ships they contain. Seeing fleets of 15-20 ships will be common during the late part of the game. UFO Spawn Locations The game will start with 3 to 6 spawn locations and a new spawn location will appear every 7 to 10 turns depending on the skill level you started the game with. Its this progression that will eventually lead to you losing the game... but keep in mind your goal is to get the highest score possible! Combat Combat is very unique and has a very quick pace to it. UFO ships will start to appear and move while shooting both bullets and missiles. They will dance around the skies and then disappear just as quickly as they appeared. You will move your ships aimer around the screen and fire both machine gun bullets and missiles. Ending The Game The game ends when you have either lost your home planet, or you have lost all of your ships. You score points each turn for the remaining armor of your space stations and home planet, so even just taking damage to them will reduce your score each turn. You also score points for destroying UFO's during combat.",0,0.0,0,677,24,True,2022

Viewers can also cooperate at certain times to create special surprises for you. These can make the run harder, so keep an eye out for whatever your viewers throw your way! Typing Vs Chat Type to survive! In a zombie apocalypse, you're being swarmed from all sides by zombies that your viewers will spawn in. You must shoot the zombies by typing their names - each zombie is named after the viewer that spawned them in. Remember to type 'reload' to reload your gun when you run out of bullets.

62564,SGS Korean War,2022-10-27,23.99,0,Strategy Game Studio,Avalon Digital,Strategy,"The Korean War This war is remembered as the first intense conflict of the Cold War, but usually not much more than that. Few know that the conflict’s first year was a very rapid and dynamic Blitkrieg-like struggle, with the North sudden invasion at the beginning of summer 1950 and the counter-offensive from the United Nations in Fall and early Winter, followed by the intense counter-offensive led by Communist China in winter and spring of the following year. Then after this active phase, the mobile aspect of the war was obliterated in memories by months of stagnation and tense struggles alongside a rarely fluctuating line of fortified positions, reminding many of the trench warfare of the Great War. The ‘hot” part of the conflict finally ceased in 1953 with an armistice, but officially the war has not ended. The Scenarios The goal of the game is to recreate the different phases of the war, either in a complete grand campaign covering the whole actual duration, or in shorter scenarios set at different starting points, such as: • Chosin Scenario : a 3-turns scenario on the infamous battles around Chosin reservoir in Winter 1950 • Incheon Scenario : a 4-turns scenario of the landing at Inchon and subsequent liberation of Seoul, Fall 1950 • Pusan Perimeter scenario : a 4-turns scenario covering the final NK attempt to conquer all of Korea, Summer 1950 • Spring Offensive scenario : a 4-turns scenario covering the Chinese offensive against Seoul in 1951. • Invasion of South Korea Campaign : a short 3 months (12 turns) campaign covering the initial North Korean invasion, early Summer 1950 • Naktong Campaign : a short 2 months (9 turns) campaign covering the Battle for the Pusan Perimeter, Summer 1950 • Across the 38th Parallel Campaign : a short 4 months (16 turns) campaign covering the UN counter-offensive, from Fall 1950 • China Enters Campaign : a medium 6 months (25 turns) campaign covering the Chinese intervention from Late 1950 • The 1951 Campaign : a medium 24 months campaign (100 turns) covering the war from Spring 1951. • The 1952 Campaign : a medium 12 months campaign (50 turns) covering the war from Spring 1952. • The Korean War Grand Campaign : the whole war (150 turns), from June 1950 till the end. All turns in the various scenarios and campaigns above represent one week, between 26 June 1950 and 15 May 1953. One player represents the North Korean and Chinese Communist armies, with Soviet backup, and the other plays the United Nations, comprising South Koreans, UNO, Commonwealth and American forces. The Communists have very numerous land forces at the start of the game, and the Chinese reinforcements are impressive, but they are lacking strength in the air (except when the Migs arrive). The South Korean player must first hold desperately against the initial invasion, waiting for American reinforcements to alter the course of events. Their aerial superiority and economic might are important and can compensate for the lower numbers. Scale The game scale is at the regimental level for land units of both sides, with smaller units (e.g. armor bataillons, UN contingents, partisants) beign also present. Air units are in the form of squadrons. Naval units are present, although most are abstracted at Task Force groups levels (as the war at sea was too much one-sided to be of sufficient interest in our game besides logistical and naval support aspects). Other items such as fortifications, minefields, HQ’s, logistical depots or vehicles, or even industrial infrastructures (to cover the strategic warfare aspects) are also present in good numbers. The map covers all of Korea, from the border with China and the Soviet Union till the southern Straits of Korea and Japan. All natural types of terrain of the peninsula are present, as well as a new model of weather system, showing map changes when it rains or snows, and with the relevant impact on military operations. Players and Sides Players will not only enter detailed military operations and battles (both on land and in the air) but also join in the political and diplomatic aspects of the war, with most of those being handled through the play of cards or via the occurrence of events. In the military field, you have to handle troop movements and maneuvers, organization of air, HQ and artillery supports, breathroughs, exploitations, build-up of logistical networks or fortified lines. Strategic bombing of the Communist industrial and transportation base is also present, as well as popular resistance, training of troops, recompletion of forces, management of unit rotation or partisan warfare. As the United Nations, the uncertainty as to when Chinese intervention will occur in the game (an almost certain outcome, but at an unknown date… yet) will be a decisive factor for your military campaign but also for the decisions you can take in politics (shall MacArthur retain command?) or dipliomacy (shall we accept help from Nationalist China?). On the Communist side, the amount and blatancy of Soviet support, as well as Mao’s implication in the conflict are tools at your disposal. Also, the grand campaign offers option to explore various opening moves and states: what-if the North (or the South) was better prepared, or the USAF ready to jump-in, or extensive fortifications built alongside the 38th Parallel. All of this is for you to discover in the most detailed recreation of the Korean War to date. Duration Variable according to scenarios, from a few hours for the shortest scenarios to 100+ hours for the full war. Balance No side is specifically advantaged. Both are playable and enjoyable once you capture the essence of their specific strong points and weaknesses.

Jim's Adventure is a retro style 2D maze runner. Using simple WASD controls, you must guide Jim through the maze, also known as the Evil Dr. Evins' house. You must find you way to the end of the maze while avoiding Dr. Evins' Robots. These robots patrol using random direction movements and chase you when you get too close, adding a bigger challenge to the game. Your progress saves whenever you get to a new level so you can come back to it later. The Story The world knows Dr. Evins, but they don't know who he really is. Unlike most Journalists, Jim does not heap loads of praise on this man. Jim has always been wary of Dr. Evins' increasing power in the political and economic sectors. Jim has been publishing critical news pieces on this shifty doctor on his blog, since no other news agencies will touch such content. Given this criticism, Jim found it odd to receive a call from Dr. Evins himself inviting him to his mansion for an in person interview. So after getting his trusty pen and paper, he went to the not so good doctors house. After arriving and being let in though an automatic door, Jim interred. However, the door slammed behind him, then the Doctor, talking over his in house PA system, reveled his evil plan because that is what evil doctors do. He told Jim that in the basement of the mansion, he had created a world conquering robot that he will release shortly, to conquer the world Jim surmised. The doctor continued saying that Jim would not see it because his home security robots would kill him before he could get to it. But nothing has kept Jim from a good story, not even killer robots, or the doctor's bleak interior deign. And who knows, he might just be able to stop this mad man's mission.",1,0.99,1,606,0,True,2022

All Tyberians had to do in order to enter his paradise was to simply die at the hands of his Dead Army. The war was over before it even began, with thousands perishing in the Tyrant's wake, only to be brought into his fold as undying thralls, bound by magic. The few living warriors left are scattered across the remnants of their homeland, tirelessly looking for a way to turn the tables on the tyrannical Tyrant. Lead a great Uprising, defeat the Dead Army, and drive the monstrous overlord back into the depths of the sea from whence he came. Tyrant's Blessing is a tactical turn-based game where your ability to plan, adapt, and strategize is more important than min-maxing your units or finding the sharpest sword in the hoard. Select battles every day, make challenging choices, and cleverly use the strengths of these rag-tag insurgents to defeat the undead hordes and maybe - just maybe - bring real life back to Tyberia. Before you bring the battle to the Tyrant's doorstep, you'll have to make sure you live long enough to reclaim the Island. Decide whether to fight, rescue the living from the Undying, or gather your strength. Every choice matters throughout every day of the Uprising. As you fight your way across the face of Tyberia, face off against random encounters that force difficult decisions. Do you intervene and fight highwaymen, putting your warriors at risk? Do you try to save a child, risking valuable time and resources? Only your morals and ideals hold the answer. Pick your heroic roster carefully. Screeg, the elder wizard advising the Uprising, can only teleport three heroes and a pet at once: Do you send your elite warriors in? Or rookies to train and hold the line? Are they up to the task? Can you handle the consequences? The Tyrant can’t be defeated without destroying an army's worth of the Undying. However, winning is more than simply whacking the enemy as hard as you can. Analyze the fray and plan accordingly. Place warriors around the battlefield to gain strategic advantages. Stay ever mindful of surroundings: kick up dust to make the enemies lose sight or hop over stones and dodge into bushes to avoid enemy attacks. Mind the enemy: every attack is telegraphed, but take care, simply moving away leaves behind a shadow. This remnant of a character can still be attacked if there is no way to avoid it... Knock the enemies out of the way and into obstacles, shield weaker heroes with ones that can tank damage, as well as chain powerful elemental attacks using the environment. Brute force works, but fight smarter, not harder. Each of your heroes has their own personality, properties, and abilities. Who will you choose to put in harm’s way? Enlist twenty hallowed heroes, each with a distinct set of abilities that can dramatically alter the course of any battle. But stay mindful: Not all heroes appear in a playthrough - and not everyone is guaranteed to make it to the finish line of this quest. Pick the right team for the task. An assassin may thrive in confined spaces, while an archer will suffer in close quarters. Some heroes may even bring their pets along, who might provide just enough leverage to win a battle for the group. Even if heroes fall, they can still be freed from the Tyrant's grasp.

The only different is you cannot take these items anytime. They can only be taken when the protagonist realizes it’s useful.",0,0.0,0,486,9,True,2022
