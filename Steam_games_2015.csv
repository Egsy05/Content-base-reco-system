Pax is trapped in a terrible nightmare. You control Pax as he is pursued by the besotted Truffle Princess, combining classic platforming action with imaginative puzzle-solving as you must move, stack, and use objects to create new paths to jump and clamber on, all while the Truffle Princess draws ever closer. Being in a dream, even if it is a nightmare, can have its advantages. Pax can transform into different forms to help him negotiate the world, each with its own distinct and powerful abilities. You can use the forms to scamper across vertical walls, turn invisible, or even fly across vast chasms, but using them at the right time is the key. Mushroom Men: Truffle Trouble hooks you with its distinct gameplay, then keeps you engaged with its beautiful worlds, quirky humor, and Pax’s super-powered forms. Platforming - Pax can run, jump, climb, cling to ledges, push, pull, and grab objects, and use his special Form abilities to overcome obstacles. Puzzles - Pax is able to manipulate his environment through stacking or moving objects in the world, allowing you to creatively use parts of the environment to create new paths for platforming your way forward. The Chase - As you move through the levels you are under a time pressure: the Truffle Princess is after you, steadily smashing her way through the level. You must find a way to keep ahead, increasing your lead enough so that you have time to puzzle through the tricky parts. Even the most basic stretches of levels become critical as you push to stretch your lead. Enemies - Scattered throughout the levels are opponents that you want to avoid or destroy. Each opponent has a different set of abilities. Some move about in a small area, others fly about and attack you from range.

52000,Welcome to Boon Hill,2015-10-31,7.99,0,Matthew Ritter,14 Hours Productions,"Indie,Simulation","An afternoon spent walking between the gravestones reading the whispers of those that have passed. This is the experience Boon Hill promises to give. A graveyard simulator, with all the adventure of exploring a real graveyard without looking like a creeper. To put it as simply as possible, Boon Hill is a game about reading gravestones. There might be a few other elements in the final product but the bulk of the game would be just walking through a graveyard, reading epitaphs and thinking about who these people were and never will be again. Free Roaming The game itself has no win scenario. As the protagonist you'll start with a specific gravestone you're looking for, but finding it won't end the game. Looking at every gravestone once won't end the game. Doing everything there possibly is to do won't end the game. The game ends when you decide to leave the graveyard. The experience is yours. It isn't dictated by some preset guidelines. No Danger The game has no lose scenario either. There is nothing threatening the player. No zombies bursting up from the graves and no vampires hidden deep in the mausoleums. The gravedigger is not digging a grave for you and it's impossible to be buried alive. There's nothing to be afraid of at Boon Hill, except perhaps your own mortality, despite what some NPCs might tell you. Though they do say you should never fall asleep in a graveyard. Discover Mystery In the Graveyard Boon Hill is not aimless. Boon Hill is about inferred stories, about the connections people have that continue even after they die. The graveyard tells many tales woven by those who've long since passed on: stories of love, life, sorrow, and joy, told over generations. The threads of narrative are woven throughout the gravestones for you to discover, if you have the inkling to look. A row of graves all with the same last name, most of them having died very young, suggests a specific set of circumstances. An epitaph that reads 'Survived by no one' is dour, yes, but clearly someone carried out their last wishes. Here, people are tied together by something as simple as similar birth dates, the places they were born or died, and even the styles of their grave markers. Subtle stories abound in the rows of stone. The specifics of what you can expect from Boon Hill: Fancy, advanced 16-bit graphics! The kind of graphics you drooled over twenty years ago. The ability to choose your gender as male OR female! How very progressive. Well over a thousand individual graves and epitaphs! It's the whole point of the game, after all. Several NPCs to interact with! At least more than two. Crows! The graveyard has a lot of crows. It's as much a feature as anything else. Figure out what's up with that weird goth chick! She's kinda creepy. Virtual graveyard! Real depression! Feelings of depression are not guaranteed, but reading epitaphs is not known as a heartwarming pastime. Lie in an open grave! Haven't you always wanted to do that? Real-time mourning! You'll be able to leave flowers, and look sad. All in real time! Only three flowers allowed per visit of the grounds. But mostly, Learn about the history of this town and the kind of people that lived their through the legacy they have left behind in the graveyard boon hill.",37,295.63,29,2983,1,True,2015

If you like stealth kills, explore for ammo, use your pistol carefully(=combat) and aim for headshots and move around... If you want to knock out enemies, don't use your pistol, use your tazer, observe their patrol points and knock them out one by one... If you want to create your own darkness, use your pistol on lights, not on enemies... If you want to 'ghost' the entire game that is also possible, but you'll have to keep an eye your light meter and environment all the time... If you want to lure enemies around, use throwable objects, not any weapons... If you are around monsters and get caught, use your pistol to defend yourself until you find some cover/hiding spot... Further in the game, if you are bored of sneaking around, use your shotgun to blast enemies, but you have to explore around carefully to collect ammo first... Unique puzzles in that require exploration and information gathering in classic adventure style. Wide variety in environments...In Solarix, you'll travel from cramped corridors to vast exotic forests to giant space stations to ominous underground facilities. Each level has its own strategy; each strategy is created by you. Some levels you'll have to run away from monsters, in some levels you'll want to directly confront them. One level will require you explore around in classical-adventure style to solve puzzles, whereas another level will require you to sneak around carefully. Rich in-game content – you’ll encounter not just human enemies and monsters but you’ll have to hack your way through turrets, security cameras, sniper-robots and flying drones.

An emergent, living world: Everything on the island is subject to biological and physical rules, and nothing comes from nothing: will you hunt the last dinosaur of its species for a steak, or will you protect it from extinction and make sure its eggs hatch? These are the dilemmas you'll face in the game, as long as YOU don't get extinct. Development: To see all the features planned for the full release and the ideas we are considering, please check the development roadmap , and feel free to join the discussion and make suggestions! Game Modes: God : Manage the island ecology, change the weather, trigger devastating events, and see how the ecosystem adapts. Survival : Join the island as a stranded human, see how long you can survive as part of it, and how your body changes in the process. World Features: Ecology simulation : the game simulates a Cretaceous ecosystem populated mainly by dinosaurs. Animals and plants don't 'spawn'; they are born, grow, reproduce and die. DinoSystem uses a seasonal model that calculates day/night length, relative position of the sun, and influences the weather; seasons transition is totally gradual. Realistic weather model that takes into account variables like time of day, humidity, temperature, and pressure; generating weather conditions like rain, snow, wind, sand/snowstorms, thunderstorm and fog. Thunders can trigger wildfires , which can burn down entire forests. Realistic water cycle : rain creates puddles that can either evaporate or grow into ponds and lakes. Evaporation takes into account air humidity, temperature and sun exposure. Terrain changes according to factors like presence of water, weather, vegetation, and location . Any area can become fertile or arid, new forest or grasslands may form or disappear over time. Fire (from torches to campfires and wildfires) consumes available fuel , releasing heat and light, and it's influenced by air humidity and wind; you body and all objects near a fire are heated up. Fire can spread to nearby vegetation and trigger a wildfire, if ambient conditions are favourable. Animals AI allows them to survive in their world and adapt; they'll reproduce, care for their youngs, look for protection or compete for food and mating. Each new island is generated at game start , based on parameters set by the player. Everything , from dead animals to branches, decomposes based on factors like temperature, humidity, and location. There is no 'timer' after which an item or a carcass disappears. Survival Features: Deep, complex and rewarding character progression system : metabolism, body muscles and fat change according to your lifestyle, and your character's sprite changes in appearance to reflect this. Get fat to survive winter, get slim to be lighter and swifter, or get muscular to be stronger in combat and more capable of hard work, but make sure to eat enough proteins. Needs like thirst and hunger are not just bars that drop at a constant rate : everything, from performing actions to metabolism and body weight, influence the rate at which you burn calories, consume water or get tired. For example, high temperature or intense activity make you sweat, requiring you to drink more water. Also, you won't die directly by malnutrition, but as you starve you lose fat, until you become too weak and eventually die from the elements. Dozens of skills, both mental and physical, that raise as you perform the related action ; but can also decay if you don't practice them for a long time. Crafting/Building system allowing you to create items, clothing, weapons , as well as build your own shelter (unless you find a cave..). Foods with different nutrition values : meat is valuable because of proteins, but make sure you cook it... Many more features will be added throughout the development! Again, check the development roadmap , and feel free to get involved and suggest new features. ### NOTE FOR LAPTOP USERS ### If you have a decent graphics card and still have bad performance, it's possible your card is not being used to run the game.

The city and our people were protected by a group of wise mystics. They trained in the art of inner spirit and wielded ancient weapons known as Kuna Muskets. The mystics lived on the edge of the city on platforms we called the 'Sky Ways'. Thought to be built from magic these platforms kept balance and if were ever lost the city would fall into eternal darkness. They caught us off guard... floating demons inhabiting bodies of metal stormed the city under the light of the two crescent moons. We fought long and hard but their numbers were many, we could not hold them. They made their way into the city killing any in sight, thousands of Pithians slain within hours. I watched helplessly as my own mystic brothers were cast down in blood. Luckily I was able to make it to the docks... me, your pregnant mother and and a couple hundred badly wounded Pithians escaped via airship. We would fly east to the floating mountains of Kiatu where we would remain in hiding for many years. We now live in seclusion here on Kiatu, waiting for the day when the prophecy would be fulfilled. It is foretold that one day a young mystic would travel back to Pithia and reclaim it for his people, avenging his ancestors and ridding the city of evil.

Expand your Trainz collection with a huge range of additional routes, sessions, locos and rolling stock, all at 75% off the regular pricing. SEE ALSO - Trainz Railroad Simulator 2019 The latest version of Trainz delivers better graphics, improved performance and greater stability (plus a whole range of new content). Search the Steam Store. What makes Trainz so special? Trainz: A New Era is far more than a train simulator. Sure there are hundreds of locos and dozens of routes and sessions you can drive in the Platinum Edition Bundle. But the real power of Trainz comes with all the extra things you can do beyond the builtin-in content set. All the tools to build your own railroad are included, and in fact, every route you see in Trainz is created by customers just like you. There are now well over 10,000 routes available on the Trainz Download Station (DLS) that you can download for free and enjoy. So when people tell you 'you have to buy lots of DLC' remind them that the choice is theirs, with plenty of high quality free routes and content available on the DLS. Key Features All-new graphics engine with full world shadows and per-pixel lighting Multiplayer Share your enthusiasm with other rail fans and combine your efforts with others to operate a working rail line! Our most accurate simulation yet with real time world physics and editing tools! Our physics use a variety of configurable inputs such as engine powers, train weight and rolling resistance whilst taking into account factors like track gradient, curve resistance and track adhesion for each train car when accelerating or decelerating. The brand new real time physics editing tools allow players to tune physics 'on-the-fly' to take their simulation's performance even further. Brand-new Real-time Physics Editing tools enable users to enter known specifications to accurately monitor all the forces at work. Things like tractive effort, drawbar pull or brake pipe pressure can be monitored at a specific point along the train and input values adjusted 'on-the-fly'. By analysing and tuning performance without leaving the simulation, real-world train characteristics can be matched perfectly. (It's a bit like running a virtual dynamometer car). If physics aren't your thing, don't worry. You can leave the fine-tuning of your favourite locomotive's performance to the experts whilst still having the choice between 'Realistic Mode' or 'Easy Mode' driving options. Procedurally animated spline junctions An updated set of track laying tools are provided in Surveyor to automatically adds frogs/vee, blades, and checkrails in the correct place on the tracks when making a switch, turnout or junction. The blades then animate as the junction direction is changed. Realistic cab sway and external train motion Using a new suspension modelling system and additional track and traincar parameters, cab sway and 'car rocking' from both internal and external perspective provide more realistic train motion visuals. When running on rough track, cars will wobble and shake independently. Smoke and weather affected by world objects New particle effects and collision systems will prevent rain penetrating a tunnel, smoke will billow out from the underside of a bridge or the top of a tunnel and all particle effects will change velocity, direction and flow more naturally.

It is based on the PS Vita version of the game. Below is a description of the entire trilogy. Easy to play, difficult to master, the Umihara Kawase Trilogy is a collection of three physics-based puzzle/platformer games with over 20 years of gaming history. Developed by the creators of the original game (Kiyoshi Sakai and Toshinobu Kondo), this cult classic was a Japanese indie smash hit! Umihara Kawase is the name of our backpacking, Japanese, sushi chef heroine armed with a fishing rod, elastic fishing line, and a fishing hook. Face fish-like enemies, conveyor belts, spikes, watery pits, time travel and more. Collect items, and find your way to the end of each level. The deeper into this dream-like world that you venture, the more challenging the solutions and the greater the time pressure becomes. Along the way, look out for shortcuts and secret exits, and unlock bonus levels. The elasticity of Umihara’s fishing line sets the Umihara Kawase Trilogy apart from other games, giving unprecedented levels of mobility and discovery. Tightening the line or giving lots of slack can be the difference between success or failure. The elastic nature of the fishing line allows the player to stretch down to otherwise unreachable areas or be catapulted upwards. Trilogy Features Physics-based puzzle/platforming that challenges your reflexes and brainpower Extreme elastic fishing-line physics give you advanced control Many stages with branching paths across three complete games Steam Workshop support in all three games for sharing replays Four playable characters (in Sayonara Umihara Kawase) Face giant, aquatic bosses like a tadpole, a seahorse, and more Steam Achievements, Trading Cards, Leaderboards, and Cloud Saving Full Steam controller support for all three games (optional)",138,2068.62,120,3009,30,True,2015

39626,The Fall of the Dungeon Guardians - Enhanced Edition,2015-11-06,7.99,16,Mana Games,Mana Games,"Indie,RPG,Strategy","Introduction : The Fall of the Dungeon Guardians is an RPG Dungeon Crawler game, in First Person View, inspired by classics like Dungeon Master™ and Might &amp; Magic®, but featuring a modern tactical combat based on the triptych “tank/damage dealer/healer” mechanism coupled with the threat &amp; aggro system and an active pause. Story : You’re a newly employed guard of a prison deep inside a dungeon. The night of your arrival, strange things happen and when you wake up in the morning, all prisoners have escaped amidst chaos. The warden wisely decides to leave the dungeon as quickly as possible, while tasking you to run after the escaping prisoners. You then assemble your team and venture into the mysterious dungeon. A Call For Adventure : Enter a big, massive dungeon, full of danger, mystery and secrets. Fight your way through hordes of enemies and powerful creatures. Explore intricate corridors, underground palaces, mines fallen into oblivion and evil crypts. Solve puzzles, avoid deadly traps, uncover hidden passages, and keep your bearing through mazes &amp; hallways. Character Building : You’ll take command of a party of 4 guardians. Each guardian comes with a set of spells &amp; abilities, with new ones appearing over the course of the adventure. For each new level reached, the guardians get a point to use in their talent trees, allowing them to reinforce their abilities or gain new powers. There are 4 classes to choose from: the warrior, the healer, the mage &amp; the rogue. Each class has 3 specializations represented by a talent tree, and each specialization comes with its own set of abilities. So you have 12 base build-ups. In addition, your guardians can choose freely to spend their talent points in any of the 3 specializations of their class, allowing for even more varied set-ups. The dungeon is filled with loot: epic armors, legendary weapons and mystical, magical items. Often when you kill a group of enemies, they’ll drop a random piece of equipment that one of your guardians can use, raising more and more of their powers. Evolved Combat System : The combat is focused on the triptych “tank/damage dealer/healer” mechanism, coupled with an exciting threat mechanism: your healer’s spells directly threaten all the enemies nearby, and thus your tank must use his abilities to attract their wrath and protect the healer. The tank must then be able to mitigate a lot of the enemy damage using his defensive skills. Your last 2 guardians will be the damage dealers, trying to kill the enemies as fast as possible, while they’re busy with the tank. All guardians get a lot of abilities and not only will using the right one at the right moment be essential to your party’s survival, but also combining different abilities in sequence to maximize their efficiency will be required to vanquish your strongest foes. It sounds like a lot, but fortunately the game comes with an active pause: you can pause the game whenever you feel like it, check everything, queue the next abilities for your guardians, and then resume the game. You don’t like tanks, or you don’t like pausing the game? No problem, just lower the game difficulty, and you’ll be able to play without a real tank or pausing. You can precisely tune the difficulty at any time during your exploration. Unlike old-school FPV Dungeon Crawlers, you don’t have to strafe-turn-strafe-turn all the time in Dungeon Guardians. Your tank comes with serious defensive skills (armor, dodge &amp; parry) that let him handle most of the enemy attacks, as long as the healer backs him up. So most fights are done while standing your ground. However, occasionally your whole party will have to dodge some extremely powerful enemy attacks, usually by walking back, so you’ll still need some moving reflexes and awareness of your surroundings during the fights. Built-in Map editor &amp; Modding : The game comes with a full featured map editor, letting you create your own dungeons. The basics are very simple, but a bit of learning will be required to handle the more advanced puzzle mechanisms. Additionally, with the Modding SDK, you’ll be able to fine-tune the existing enemies, classes, specializations, abilities, talents, gear, and enchantments, and with a bit of dedication you should be able to add your own, and even add sound FX or music. Game Features : 4-character Party Grid-based movement : your party moves 1 square at the time, and turns by a quarter First person view 4 classes, 12 specializations 5 playable races : human, dwarf, elf, dark elf, halfling Active pause (ie: you can pause the game and still queue commands for your party members), and numerous optional auto-pauses 25-50 hours of gameplay, depending on your own skills and the difficulty settings 20 bosses, each with an unique strategy 100 kinds of creatures (including variations) Puzzles (the few ones required to finish the game are easy to solve) A lot of tactical combat Built-in Map Editor &amp; Modding support",556,4442.4400000000005,383,2977,46,True,2015

CPUCores does this by micromanaging your Windows OS and non-essential applications to delivery maximum CPU to your game! 1) DIRECT STEAM INTEGRATION CPUCores automatically detects all of your Steam games. 2) OS OPTIMIZATION To start, CPUCores will isolate your entire OS to your first core. Secondly, CPUCores examines and constrains key Windows services that are not essential and known to hog CPU resources. Third, CPUCores examines and isolate key Windows processes to ensure a perfect balance of CPU savings without starving key Windows processes. 3) GAME OPTIMIZATION CPUCores will isolate and dedicate processing cores to be exclusively used by your game. CPUCores will allow game-specific hyper-thread disabling/enabling. 4) BACKGROUND / NON-GAME OPTIMIZATIONS CPUCores examines what non-OS and non-game operations your PC is running. It will do things such as constrain non-game programs to your first processing core. 5) EXTRAS Ability to 'START RANDOM GAME' with 1 button click! Fully supporting VR games! Support for non-Steam games Support for general, non-game applications like video editing, graphic design and more! Convenient game sorting options makes large Steam libraries manageable Incredible community surrounding the software! Direct contact with the developer for suggestions on feature updates! The impact of how CPUCores will help with FPS depends on essentially 2 things: #1 Your PC Hardware #2 The game itself Here are some benchmarks we've recently seen from our test system: ARMA III - 17.5% FPS Increase! Team Fortress 2 - 58% FPS Increase! TombRaider - 6.3% FPS Increase Left4Dead2 - 14% FPS Increase The CPUCores application identifies dozens of Windows programs, background processes, and non-gaming applications, and immediately controls and isolates them to a subsection of your total CPU resources. CPUCores will then free up a block of CPU resources and dedicated it specifically for a game. You can then launch a Steam game, or any game/program, directly via the CPUCores application. This enables CPUCores to control the processor usage for that game/program and ensure it has dedicated usage to processing cores.

Although some vortices will take several stage to destroy. Upon reaching a level where the vortex can be totally destroyed, it will unleash the most dangerous of its swarms to make things a lot harder for our players. The twist we've added in this game is that the vortex on each level will keep growing, throwing ever increasing waves of enemies to overwhelm the player, so that they must continually fight to push the vortex back. The game has been especially designed to play with up to 3 friends, although we're considering adding an optional fourth player based on player feedback. To implode the vortices, the player must destroy enemies to collect their energy. On top of the vortex there are two spheres: The player level (blue sphere) and the vortex level (red sphere). When the energy item sent by the player reaches the vortex, the blue sphere shrinks the black hole, symbolized with the red sphere. But in the other hand the black hole is constantly growing stretching the blue sphere. The game ends when the blue sphere makes the red one disappear or the red one grows to its maximum size. The concept is kind of new, reuses the concept based in Beekyr and improves it by removing the unnecessary bits. Game's history The alien war machines caught us by surprise. A strange energy vortex appeared near colony Vehar-12, then they came, swarming from the centre of the vortex. The first attack was just over 20 Eartho-days ago and already eighteen colonies have been lost. 56 million souls, gone. Now they're approaching Earthos, our biggest colony. We're fighting back, but if it falls, we will be all but destroyed. The vortices had seemed all but indestructible. But now we have hope. Our technicians patched together a captured war machine, and discovered the key to the vortices, a new kind of energy they've dubbed 'Lumergy'. Our first tests of the device lead to an unexpected discovery. The energy used to create a vortex could also be used to destroy one. Using our modified war machine we can collect the Lumergy, and reverse its energy to collapse a vortex, destroying the swarm within. We can predict where the next vortex will open, and we can destroy it. We have only one chance at this, only one ship. Your only mission: Destroy the vortices.

Verdun key features include: Experience World War One gameplay: Accurate weaponry with realistic bullet physics, skill based weapon handling, poisonous gas with a claustrophobic gas mask experience, horrendous gore effects, and ferocious artillery barrages Tactical squad-based FPS: 15 distinctive squad types representing soldiers from 5+ countries, each with distinct weapons and equipment True trench warfare: Real-time dynamic frontline with momentum based attack and counter-attack gameplay Authentic World War 1 setting: Typical WW1 music and style, historical battlefields representing the most active parts of the Western Front Challenging game modes: team-based Frontlines, tactical Attrition, skill-based Rifle Deathmatch, and relentless Squad Defense WW1 on the Western Front The gameplay in this true WW1 battlefield experience is as immersive and gritty as it can get, with features such as optional realistic gore which portrays the true horror of the First World War and authentic weaponry including artillery and gas. Weapons need to be handled with skill - each gun handles differently and there are no floating crosshairs to aid your aim, along with realistic bullet physics to contend with. Battle your way across no man’s land to capture the next enemy trench line, before switching to defense to protect your gains in the Frontlines game mode. Keep your head down or quickly don your mask in the event of artillery strikes or gas attacks. This unforgiving war isn’t for the faint hearted! Authentic World War One Setting The WW1 Game Series currently includes Verdun, Tannenberg (set on the Eastern Front), and the upcoming Isonzo, which is set on the Italian Front. These authentic WW1 shooters let players choose from a range of squads from across the war, as they fight for control of the ever-changing frontlines. For Verdun, we carried out extensive field research at the battlefield itself and were advised by knowledgeable historians to make sure the individual elements in Verdun are as historically accurate as it can get. Uniforms have been recreated to the tiniest detail, the weapons are modeled to exact references and the maps use realistic props and terrain layouts. Everything in the game has been tailored to recreate the grim atmosphere so typical of WW1, from the immersive interface and war torn maps to realistic sounds and voices that evoke the feeling of actually being there in the mud covered trenches, peering out over no man's land in search of the enemy.

Their dream is to build the first multicellular creatures. To succeed in creating order from chaos, they will have to dig tunnels, build towers, and construct bridges — having no tools but their triangular bodies and their special abilities! Using just 7 of these abilities, Volvox offers 250 hand-drawn levels, for about 60 hours of play, and that's without counting achievements and stats! This variety of situations is possible thanks to the versatile main mechanic, inspired by the physical phenomenon of 'rolling without slipping', the relationship between the path traveled by a body — in this case a Trimoeba! — and its rotation. Level surfaces and Trimoebas influence each other, resulting in intricate puzzles and enigmatic challenges. Volvox's difficulty escalates quickly, but it does not require fast response times or specialized experience. It is difficult because almost no one is used to thinking in terms of rotating triangles: for this reason, both hardcore and casual players can find it interesting and challenging. Upon completing the game for the first time, a new advanced mode will be unlocked to test your skills in a different way. Volvox is not just a traditional puzzle game, as it is also designed as mental flexibility training, encouraging the player to continuously find new ways to use the resources available, to contrast the phenomenon of 'functional fixedness'. Volvox is a game richly filled with triangles, eyes, and curls, which appear constantly in various forms in characters, controls, and backgrounds, for a strongly organic aesthetic. The game's visual style comes from watercolor painting, and this art style consciously alludes to cellular diffusion phenomena. In addition to the advanced mode mentioned above, completing the game for the first time unlocks new options to change the backgrounds in 16 variants, altering your perception of Volvox while experimenting with the second mode. The sound effects and music were produced by making extensive use of a unique instrument called a 'hang'. The hang is a recent invention, lacking previous cultural connections, perfect to portray a time before time: the time of life's beginning. The themes of birth and reproduction are interlaced with the game's primary campaign, presenting a strong message of love for life and celebrating life's beauty in all its shapes, down to the simplest worm.

'Those who would enter the underworld shall not only forfeit their lives... ...but bring oblivion to all mankind.' WARNING: THIS GAME IS ACTUALLY DIFFERENT! This game features a very deep, truly physics based combat system. This is not just some animation feature, it is a fundamental difference that is central to gameplay. Real momentum, forces and collisions are always at play here, every nuance of your inputs is crucial to the outcome.

This game is a sequel of the original classic dinosaur hunting video game, Carnivores: Dinosaur Hunter. It’s an authentic hunting simulation where you track and stalk your prey. Careful and thoughtful consideration must be taken during the hunt; to survive you'll need to know your preys temperament and mannerisms, and just like in real hunting, you need to be aware of your surroundings (you don't want to be caught upwind of a T-Rex or you'll end being lunch). Remember you're not hunting deer, you're hunting dinosaurs. You’ll visit huge, beautifully rendered and realistic 3D environments, each with their own unique Eco systems. There are pristine beaches, dense jungles, pine forests, muddy marshes, rocky plains and deserts to explore. Environments can be used to increase the odds of a successful hunt. Players can follow trails and track animal footprints. Awareness of wind direction is important since some dinosaurs can smell you. Using stealth and land elevation will give you a sound advantage over some of the more vicious dinosaurs. Choose between a high caliber rifle, sniper rifle, a silent crossbow or tranquilizer gun, which puts your prey to sleep instead of killing it. You can also carry sidearms. Some of your equipment includes a handheld Gadget, which includes radar and GPS satellite positioning to make tracking the beasts easier, Cover Scent which masks your smell and numerous other goodies, which will prove indispensable for your hunting adventure. There is a wide variety of different dinosaurs to hunt each with unique behaviors and intelligence. Every dinosaur in Carnivores has realistic, advanced AI logic, so from species to species , each will react differently to you. Some dinosaurs will flee if they see you, while others will become enraged and attack. During your adventure you'll experience everything from 'pea-brained' dummies to cunning dinosaurs, with heightened senses of sight, hearing and smell. So be careful and stalk your prey intelligently, otherwise you might be the one being hunted. key Features: Hunt the largest and most ferocious animals known to man – the Dinosaurs!

CUSTOMISATION: RIDE lets you choose from a vast range of gear from the leading specialist clothing manufacturers, allowing you to personalise your rider from top to toe: choose from over 100 items and 400 colour schemes! Your bike is completely customisable, in accordance with two component categories: appearance and performance. Choose from a variety of models of mirrors and wheel rims, or improve performance on the track by mounting a racing exhaust and remapping the ECU. These are just some of the components that you can customize choosing from a catalogue of more than 100 parts. TRACKS: RIDE features 15 different circuits in the various locations where the Motorcycle Festivals of the World Tour take place. Country Tracks: mountain passes, countryside, and natural parks, faithfully reproduced from the real world. City Tracks: circuits winding through the city, with long straights and tight corners that really challenge your riding reflexes. GP Tracks: actual racetracks, chosen to enhance the sensations of riding in the seat of the bike, and being able to push it right to the edge. The renewed Evolving Track System means that the track evolves lap after lap, guaranteeing improved grip along the rubbered-in ideal trajectory as it gets darker and darker as more bikes pass over it. This really helps push you towards a clean riding style, and helps you learn the braking points and the correct trajectories by studying the behaviour of your rivals.",2018,40339.82,1127,3201,54,True,2015

It focuses on being distraction-free, simple, and fully customizable. Principles We built Nimble Writer with a couple principles in mind to make it stand out as a primary application for authors: Writing without distractions or worrying about formatting. Stay more organized with many useful organizational features. Materials of reference (such as photos, drawings, scribbles of text, character information, and much more) are available at your fingertips. Don't have any limitations to the default array of features. This means full customization, with a fully customizable and scriptable interface. Turn off features you don't need, change the entire look and feel of your writing environment, and much more. If you are used to writing stories in applications such as Word or other regular office tools, you'll find that Nimble Writer will be able to help you organize bundles of stories and notes together much simpler and faster. In addition, Nimble Writer is able to import some of those old documents and convert them into the Nimble Writer format. Advantages over traditional software Traditional writing software such as Word, Open Office or Google Docs are made just for the purpose of writing, so they don't have anything that helps story writers manage their notes and reference material, and neither does it offer much customization. They don't have any kind of chapter management either. Nimble Writer has all of those things, making it a much more productive choice for story writing. Steam's advantages With Nimble Writer's presence on Steam we can use the power that Steam's platform brings us, such as Steam Cloud . This means that you will be able to save your stories and notes entirely on Steam's cloud servers, so that you can load up your stories on another computer as well, just as easy! Don't forget about Steam Workshop ! With the implementation of the Workshop, you'll be able to share interface themes and addons with the world, or just to customize the app with other people's addons!

14969,Bernie Needs Love,2015-08-21,2.99,0,Protomni Multimedia,Protomni Multimedia,"Action,Adventure,Casual,Indie,Early Access","Bernie Needs Love is, in essence, a simple and lighthearted platformer in which the player must guide Bernie, a nice but anguished old man chased by death, towards his girlfriend — while avoiding the many hazards of a poorly maintained yet beautiful city and collecting blue 'love-enhancing' pills to make it an extra-special night! A humorous portrait of social and existential issues in a media where death and sexuality are usually quite one-dimensional, Bernie Needs Love also stands out from the crowd with its charming lo-fi graphics, lovingly composed chiptune music, and hardcore difficulty level — which are sure to satisfy players who grew up in the 8-bit era. Aesthetically, Bernie Needs Love is indeed a loveletter to the games of the 80s and early 90s, but also an experiment on getting the most out of a self-imposed set of limitations: the palette is a mix of CPC, C64, and NES colors with a few odd ones to highlight certain elements, while the original chiptune soundtrack is entirely created with synthesizers that faithfully emulate the hardware of iconic 8-bit and 16-bit machines. Regardless of its nostalgic appeal, Bernie Needs Love is an up-to-date game from the depicted subjects (i.e. the anguish of life in the constant shadow of imminent death, one's need for love and sex, the pharmaceutical industry, etc.) to the modern conveniences it provides, such as automatic support for the Xbox 360 controller, quick and easy switching between the windowed and fullscreen modes, audio options (toggle-enabled and independent controls for Music and SFX), and saving the player progress. Even the hair-pulling difficulty is balanced with infinite lives, immediate restart upon death, and no loading whatsoever after the first loading screen upon start (which shouldn't take more then 3 seconds, by the way). The game is already available, but will remain in beta while stages and features are added. Once we reach the 30 planned stages (we're currently working on stages 11 to 20), the beta phase and the correspondent discounted price will be over. Development is expected to be complete in Q4 2016. The 30 stages are divided as follows: Stages 01 to 10 -&gt; Downtown (Implemented) Stages 11 to 20 -&gt; Carnival (WIP) Stages 21 to 30 -&gt; Beach (WIP) Each area is subdivided in two to three subareas. For example, here is the subdivision of the first ten levels: Stages 01 to 07 -&gt; The Park Stages 08 and 09 -&gt; Downtown (aka Red Light District) Stage 10 -&gt; Cemetery and Boss Fight The second area, focused on the Carnival festivities of Bernie's city, starts with a street parade and will later take our protagonist to the arena where samba schools exhibit their humongous thematic cars to thousands of viewers. The first section of that carnival-themed area, however, takes place in a well-off residential area that introduces dystopian tones to Bernie's adventure that could very well be deemed cyberpunk — not necessarily moreso than our present times, but still: aerial and terrestrial drones, crowd-control forces, informational holograms, and genetically modified peacocks are just examples of such elements and a new dimension to the plot of the game. Finally, another subarea will be added for the second boss battle — but we're still deciding on the exact environment. The same model will be applied to the 3rd and last area, 'The Beach': from a sunny morning to the new year's eve celebration, levels 3-1 to 3-10 will span across such settings and finish with one last mano-a-mano with the reaper.",22,65.78,0,3054,0,True,2015

36496,Novus Inceptio,2015-10-05,12.99,98,McMagic Productions,McMagic Productions,"Adventure,Indie,RPG,Simulation,Early Access","Warning! This is an Early Access game, please read the game specification before purchasing it. Buy the game only if you understand and agree with the game specification and if you are willing to accept eventual flaws/bugs and all the changes that may occur as a result of the game development. This could also mean removing all user data. When purchasing the game you also agree to participate on tuning and testing it. Information mentioned below does not have to be valid in the current version of the game. Specifications and HW requirements may vary during further game development. Thank you for your understanding! PROLOGUE Novus Inceptio is a survival RPG set to our planet, but far in the future. Despite of the fact that the game is labeled as a survival game, it is not a typical survival challenge type of a game. This is mainly because survival elements create just the background of the game and the main aim is shifted to very complex craft system and building values in the game. Novus Inceptio is about calm playing experience which is similar to strategic and relaxing style of playing. The game contains a unique system of resources heredity and offers interaction with every game object. The objects serve not as just the background of the game. Novus Inceptio unusually blends sci-fi and fantasy themes with a hint of post apocalyptical ideas. The story is set on the planet Earth in distant future, but not the Earth as we know it nowadays. And one of the most important topic during playing the game is to reveal the truth about those who stand at the background of everything from ancient times... MAIN ELEMENTS OF THE GAME DIFFERENT POINT OF VIEW ON A SURVIVAL GAME Do not expect a typical survival challenge game, because survival elements are slightly at the background. On one hand, it is necessary to cover basic needs to survive, but these activities are not to bother you a lot, they rather intensify the world atmosphere. On the other hand, it is not difficult to get killed or to die as a result of some kind of injury. THE WORLD IS NOT JUST A DEAD BACKGROUND You can interact with nearly everything from the surface of the ground, bushes, trees, to your own buildings. In the game, no plant serves just as a decoration – would you like to pick up mushroom and eat it? Go ahead, nothing stops you. Even ordinary tree does not serve only as a source of wood, but offers other materials, too (bark, leaves, branches, resin etc.). LIVELY RELAXING ENVIRONMENT The game contains environment with natural time flow, following daily cycle and being affected by weather changes. If you stop for a moment and listen to the sounds of the nature you would recognize in which direction a wolf is hunting, you could feel the wind taking off, or you could just let yourself go while listening to atmospheric music and you could calmly relax listening to the whisper of leaves and the wind. COMPLEX CRAFT SYSTEM The game craft system is based on very difficult internal logic which requires individual production of every single part of the final product. As a reward for such game mechanics you get unique items, spiced with material bonuses, e.g. it is really important whether you craft from oak or pine wood. The game also offers an option of the craft system for those who don´t want to dive in tables and calculations. MATERIAL BONUSES The game contains a unique system of resources heredity which is used during crafting. Therefore it is possible to craft unique items with specific characteristics which happens because of the craft complexity. UNLIMITED CHARACTER OPTIONS The game allows natural character development. Only personal attributes, which you use, are enhanced. You have free hands to create a mix of specialization which you truly enjoy. You don´t have to think even before the beginning of the game about choosing a proper race or profession – character attributes are automatically adjusted according to frequent character activities. CHARACTER AGEING Yes, during playing your character gets older and can eventually die of age and therefore can move one generation further. The ageing system is our specific system of character level up. The age are experience points and a generation is a level. You dont´t have to be afraid of ageing, because it is natural way to level up, which brings you bonuses and even better attributes. BUILDING SYSTEM Thanks to modular system, while building your new home, the only limiting factor is your creativity (and if not, you can always use ready-made houses). The difference in our system is in the building process. First, you take your time and plan, only when you are ready, you start gathering material and finally build your dream house. FARMING You can build a farm around your house and grow plants needed for cooking a good quality meal or plant your own wood and bring some exotic plants from different biomes to your home. ANOMALIES In the world, there are many portals to different dimensions or times. In anomalies you can come across some unique rewards, but primarily you can learn new craft recipes which are essential for any crafting. But it is vital to pay attention to any danger hidden in those portals. SURVIVE! At the beginning of the game you find your character in the middle of wild nature. And your equipment? Only a knife and basic tools. Luckily, you're not alone! Your small personal robot A2-A is your valuable companion, but it is not there to do all the work instead of you. And because the nature does not give things for free you need to find sources of food, heat and prepare for danger, which hides in the deep wood. Disease, injury or death is your daily bread. Over some time, when you learn the laws of the world, you will be ready for your next trip. BUILD! Home is a foundation of survival and developing attributes. You can build your own house or farm and focus on one of many craft specializations. The building system works using modular elements where you can plan first, and then gather required resources for final construction (which, wouldn´t be an easy task to do). The only limiting factors are knowledge of recipes for components, your own creativity, sufficient resources and skills. Also, you can learn to craft new components by finding specific blueprints which could be found in boxes all over the world or in the anomalies. CREATE! Do you like crafting stuff? Then you will love Novus Inceptio! Each and every item in the game is unique and created by the player himself. Crafting of any item is a complex process based on many attributes, from a level of skill to material used. Crafting system does not dictate to the player what exact material has to be used to craft something, instead it reveals what type of a resource is needed, e.g. if you use stone to create an axe you create a stone axe, but if you use iron you manufacture an iron axe. You can use different type of material for any component, e.g. when you craft with wood, the system takes in consideration hardness of the wood. Novus Inceptio supports crafting items by players themselves. Therefore, item quality and technology are going to improve over time together with character attributes. EXPLORE! It is not only about settling the world, but also about surviving and creating prosperous economy. There is the whole new world of life, danger and mystery that awaits you. There are dense forests, dry deserts, tropical jungles or busy underwater life. You can get on a long journey to discover valuable materials or to find out the truth and real purpose of the restored planet. BACKGROUND STORY The dawn of gods The Galaxy is a cold and hostile place and the creators are aware of this. They have spent billions of years searching for intelligent form of life but they have never succeeded. They started protecting several planets with more developed organisms by all means available. They say: 'Life must not die out.' But at the same time, they understand all the great risks awaiting for every civilization. Therefore, the creators try to prevent destructive genocides by discreet DNA manipulation and information adding. Rebellious believers From the dawn of human civilization the creators stood beside human race. As gods, they secretly influenced physical and technological evolution or even psychological maturing of the civilization. But nobody is perfect, not even gods. Instead of maintaining peace and prosperity, humans tended to worship war and they forgot everything about their gods. The creators realized that their experiment failed and they no longer possess the powers to stop this fanatic madness among humans. When their last messenger died they returned through a portal to where they came from. To a different planet? Or to another reality? Nobody knows for sure. But what we do know is that they have never stopped collecting data through the portal. The end of the world The next important step of the human civilization took place nearly 2000 years later. During this era the nuclear fission was discovered and the whole planet became full of atomic blasts. The war was frightfully quick and effective. Those who could not hide into underground bunkers were hit by radiation and died. From billions of humans barely a few hundred thousand people survived. Without people knowing the creators received information about the end of human world, they became furious that people are so irresponsible and they returned to the Earth to wipe-out the entire human race of the planet. Human 2.0 The desolated planet kept orbiting the sun. Slowly throughout millennia it was getting rid of the deadly radiation. Finally, the creators decided to launch a new experiment. With samples of human DNA and with the help of infinite information database they returned life back to the planet. Also, they created new humans - Homo Novus to inhabit the recovering planet. And in order not to make the same mistake as before, the creators decided to accompany each and every new human clone with a personal robot A2-A. Discover worlds! A2-A is something like a guardian angel. It helps and protects people and it gradually offers complicated knowledge to them. In addition to this, it monitors behavior of each clone to prevent aggressive behaviour which caused the collapse of the previous civilization. And yet the monitoring and controling system is not reliable enough for the creators to trust it and that is why the creators installed some anomalies on the planet so the clones can travel back in time and learn from the mistakes of the past civilizations. And who knows? Maybe this would be the beginning of a new civilization which finally devotes its time to discover and learn, rather than kill and destroy. And the Creators? This time they are not leaving. They are analyzing the data from thousands of A2-As and waiting for the right moment to introduce themselves to their children personally .",1197,15549.03,155,3009,59,True,2015
