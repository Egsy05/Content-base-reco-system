Now in her early twenties, she’s abandoned that dream to focus on her uninspiring job as a computer repair technician. There’s not enough time in the day to focus on game development – and anyway, isn’t she too old to entertain such unrealistic notions? That is, until her childhood friend, Clover, introduces her to the seductive Suki. Suki is determined to turn Nekohime’s dream into a reality and finally develop a game – and she refuses to let Nekohime’s self-doubt stop her. Whether she wants to or not, Nekohime’s pulled into a brand new world, alongside these two bubbly, optimistic girls. Will they be able to make a hit game together, or will it all be for nought? And, in the end, will Nekohime manage to find true love? The unwilling heroine of the story. Her real name is ‘Sayo’, but her friends refer to her by her internet handle - much to her embarrassment. Though she dislikes being referred to by a silly nickname she made up on the spot when she was a kid, she exhibits a lot of catlike traits. She’s always seen in her cat-eared jacket, she likes taking naps, and she can be rather ‘catty’. She lacks purpose in life, and is bored by her tedious, unrewarding job. Maybe making a video game is exactly the kind of diversion she needs. One of Nekohime’s closest friends. Her real name is Chika. Though she loves revealing cosplay and dressing in tightly-fitting spandex, she’s actually an elementary school teacher. She’s warm, cheerful, bubbly, and loves playing around with finger paints, which makes her a surprisingly good fit for her job (and no, she doesn’t dress quite so outlandishly when she’s at work). Being creative, she enjoys experimenting in the kitchen and composing music. She nominates herself as the composer for her video game venture. A mischievous, vixen-like girl from Nekohime’s past, infamous for encouraging her elderly grandmother to feed her laptop’s D-Drive rice for a ‘Shinto purification ceremony’. Suki flirts with almost everyone, to such an extent it’s hard to tell whether she really means it. She also enjoys teasing people – particularly uptight people like Nekohime who get flustered easily. She grew up in a shrine, but is worlds apart from the image of a ‘traditional Japanese beauty’. She can be loud and obnoxious and incredibly pushy, but she’ll apologize when she realizes she’s gone too far. She’s also a competent digital artist, who spent a large portion of her life drawing and uploading her pictures online. After all, there’s not much else to do at a shrine.

To help Osy you will use osmosis to keep her in balance with the world around her. Add and remove Osy’s bits (solute) to control the flow of water into and out of Osy. Be careful though, add too much water to Osy and she swells up and pops, too little water and she shrivels up. Osy is the first game to show the key elements of osmosis as you play, namely bound and free water molecules. The textbooks get osmosis wrong - Osy gets it right! Features 17 levels that introduce exciting new elements and obstacles: Bit vents add more solute to the environment around Osy - add bits to match the concentration! Oxygen vents give Osy a speed boost Round crystals are hard to move, if only Osy were a little bigger... Sharp crystals can pop Osy, be careful around them! Pure water has no solute in it, and thus a higher concentration of free water that will continuously diffuse into Osy! Better not hang out in there for very long if you can help it. Osy was developed by a group of researchers, educators, and developers at the University of Georgia (UGA), with support from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Science Education Partnership Award (SEPA), The Georgia Research Alliance VentureLab, and UGA. Cogent Education was formed by members of this group to design and develop future education simulations and games. All profits from Osy will go towards the creation of other educational games and interactive software. The Science behind Osy Osmosis People can find understanding osmosis a little tricky – but this is because all the textbooks do a horrible job of explaining it! Let’s see if we can do a better job… Osmosis is the diffusion of water through a semi-permeable membrane, like Osy’s cell membrane. When you add a solute, (e.g., table salt) to water, some of the water molecules attach to the solute, so you end up with two kinds of water – “solute-bound water” and “free water”. Only the free water can diffuse through the membrane. Because diffusion is the movement of molecules from an area of high concentration to an area of low concentration, the concentration of free water determines which direction osmosis occurs. For example, when you add bits (solutes) to Osy, some of the free water molecules attach to the bits, and this reduces the concentration of free water inside Osy – so, free water diffuses into Osy and she swells up! When you remove the bits from Osy, the water molecules are released from the bits, so the concentration of free water inside Osy increases – so free water diffuses out of Osy and she shrinks. OK, that’s the science-y bit, now go and have some fun with Osy!",4,11.96,2,2477,17,True,2017

Take control of the hyperdimensional fighter craft ‘ZanFighter’ and use its advanced warp functions to defeat an army of space beasts controlled by an evil scientist! ZANGEKI WARP ’s warp capabilities bring a new twist to the style of Gradius , R-Type , and X-Multiply , and are the key to overcoming thrilling stages filled with traps and obstacles that would be impossible in regular shooting games. Use the warp functions to stop time, instantly warp through enemy fire and obstacles, and even to destroy enemies. Overview The year is 2054, and the galactic civilization faces an imminent threat of annihilation. Vicious BEMs (‘Bug Eyed Monsters’) developed by the evil genius scientist Doctor Benomiya have escaped containment and gone berserk. The Super-Electric Research Center deploys the space combat craft ‘ZanFighter’ to the fortress of Benomiya on a mission to end the onslaught of the BEMs before they end civilization. The small, but powerful ZanFighter is equipped with the super weapon ‘Warp Slash’, which makes it the only craft capable of surviving the myriad of traps in Benomiya’s fortress and countering the BEM menace. The battle begins: Earth’s most powerful combat craft against the galaxy's deadliest threat. Hyperdimensional Fighter Craft ‘ZanFighter’ A space fighter craft developed by the Super-electric Research Center, home of the legendary giant robot Supercharged Robot VULKAISER. ZanFighter specializes in close combat and possesses a variety of special capabilities including ‘Warp Slash’ and ‘Dimensional Shockwave’. Its sophisticated and highly advanced automated systems allow its pilot to concentrate on maneuvering, firing the weapons, and effectively utilizing the warp functions listed below. Warp Slash The Warp Slash is a more advanced version of the ‘Tokitome Warp’ used by the combat android ‘Meguriro’ during the Gogoh War of 1977. When activated, the warp effect stops time and transmits the ZanFighter almost instantaneously to the designated coordinates. Warp transmission utilizes multiple dimensions, allowing the ZanFighter to pass through any type of physical matter, including enemy bullets and obstacles. At the same time, it inflicts slicing damage upon any enemies that lie in the path of the warp. Dimensional Shockwave This area-effect attack inflicts damage upon any enemies present at the warp destination upon completion of the warp. Both the ‘Dimensional Shockwave’ and ‘Warp Slash’ make use of the distortion in the fabric of space caused by warping. Decoy Projects a holographic image of the ZanFighter at the warp origin. The hologram acts as a decoy, distracting enemy visuals and sensors, and drawing their fire. Decoys will disappear after a set amount of time, but a new Decoy can be redeployed at the ZanFighter’s current position when the warp is engaged again. Magno-Electric Shield A defensive shield that can protect the ZanFighter against one enemy attack. The shield activates when the shield energy reaches full charge. Shield energy charges automatically and also increases when enemy capsules are collected. Omega Crash Triggers when the Magno-electric Shield deactivates. Massive energy stored in the shield is instantly released, inflicting large damage on enemies in the surrounding area.

Cast fireballs while wearing an heavy plate armor, pierce enemies with your trusty lance or just stab them with a stake if that's your thing (the weapon's pretty weak though, I'm judging you). ▶ Your character evolves according to your playstyle. Using heavy armor will make you better with them; hitting broken things with a hammer will somehow improve your capacity at fixing things, while actually fixing the said broken things, sick! ▶ Create potions, scrap unused weapons and armors to fix your stuff, craft more arrows or just pile up a lot of scrap... why are you doing this? ▶ Talk with silly characters to get quests (like all adventurers, you just can't say no, do you?). If monsters don't kill you, the silliness and lack of basic logic of the villagers surely will. ▶ Explore dungeons to get better loot... to... explore more dungeons?

Or you can create the crimes you intend to solve, stealing the goods you'll be paid to recover, bribing prison guards to let your associates go, building your criminal empire while everyone lauds you as a hero.

34614,Virtual Temple: Order of the Golden Dawn,2017-07-26,4.99,0,keep silence,keep silence,Simulation,"Founded in London in 1888, The Order of the Golden Dawn was a secret magic fraternity. It counted amongst its members the likes of Aleister Crowley and W.B. Yeats. To become a member one must first have discovered the existence of the fraternity after which an invitation to join must have been extended. Upon accepting this invitation, one was initiated in a secret ritual designed to invoke occult energies. This is a faithful recreation that first ritual the 'Neophyte 0=0 Grade' as it is described in Israel Regardie's book 'The Golden Dawn'. All of the speaking roles are fully voiced by experienced members of the Seattle occult community. Further rituals will be available as DLC as they are completed. You can witness the ceremony as it was intended to be first viewed - through the eyes of the candidate - or you can inhabit the body of any of the officers including several of the so called 'invisible officers' giving you a giant's view of the proceedings. One of the view points allows you to walk around the temple room during the ritual to grab and inspect the various weapons and objects. Works with both HTC Vive and Oculus Rift (built using Oculus SDK for better performance). Please note that there are existing groups all over the world that are currently working these rituals with varying levels of professionalism and competency. Even though the scripts have been published for the public to read for more than a century, if you are seriously considering the path of the initiate we highly recommend that you not buy this app - all the proceedings are revealed (as best we understand them and our modest technical abilities are capable of representing them) and it would spoil your experience were you to take initiation in person. Further, these groups can provide guidance and fellowship to a level that a virtual community cannot, so if you enjoy this experience and want to learn more, we advise seeking one of these groups out.

Originally it was included to help teach people how to use a mouse correctly, but surely became one of the most popular little games to fill up a few minutes around the globe. It's quite relaxing and offers a good chance of winning with some basic playing techniques. Setting Up Klondike Solitaire Klondike Solitaire is played with a standard deck of 52 cards with all jokers removed. As you can see from the picture below, you must deal 7 columns of cards with the card at the bottom shown face up. The first column is one card (face up), the second is two cards with one card face up and the number of cards in each column increases by one until the final column is made of seven cards with the final card face up as with the other columns. Rules of Klondike Solitaire The idea of the game is to move every card onto the four foundation piles. The foundations must each start with an Ace, and cards can only be moved to the foundation in ascending order in their suit. So for example an Ace of Spades would have to be followed by the Two of Spades which would be followed by a Three of Spades and so on. After you have dealt out the set-up you will have 22 cards remaining these turned over in groups of three for a harder game or one by one for an easier game. The cards are turned over onto the previous cards so they can be used if you move a card to the layout or foundation. You can either pass through the remaining deck of cards once for a harder game or as many times as you like for an easier game. The most common choice for players is to turn over groups of three cards while allowing yourself to pass through deck as many times as you like. Rules for Moving Cards You can move a card to another column in the layout if is one lower and in an alternate color to the card being moved. So for example you can move a black 6 onto a red 7. Piles of cards in a column can be moved together if they are in descending order and in alternating colors. For example you could place a pile consisting of red 4, black 3 and red 2 onto a black 5. You can only move a King or a proper pile cards starting with a King onto an empty column. Turn over any face down cards in the columns as soon as they are free. Keep playing until you can't find any more moves or until you win by moving all the cards to foundations. How to Win Klondike Solitaire Okay, so now you are familiar with the rules here are tricks to help you win klondike solitaire. The most obvious tip is to immediately move Aces when they are available, hopefully freeing up a useful card. When you have a choice of either moving a card in the layout or bringing a card down from the remaining deck cards, it is better to choose to move cards in the layout. The only exception to this might be if you remember the previous card (or in the three card deal version) becomes useful to you once the current card is used. Don't immediately place any cards that are three or higher onto the foundation as they can sometimes be useful for placing new cards into the layout, unless of course putting a card on the foundation frees up a new card in one of the columns. The History of Solitaire The origins of solitaire are unknown. Some have speculated that the fanciful layouts in solitaire originated with the layouts of tarot cards, long used for divination and fortune-telling. The first printed references appeared in the late 1700's in northern Europe, and the game arrived in France in the early 1800's. Napolean Bonaparte was reported to have spent time playing the game during his exile at St. Helena in 1816, and solitaire (or patience as it is knonw in Europe) became a popular pastime among the French population soon thereafter. Many of the terms used in solitaire (e.g. tableau) and indeed many names of solitaire games (e.g. Rouge et Noir, La Belle Lucie, Coquette, etc.) are of French origin, and many of the early books on the subject are from France. The earliest English publications include Lady Codogan's Illustrated Games of Patience in 1874, William Dick's Games of Patience in 1883, and Professor Hoffman's Illustrated Book of Patience Games in 1892. In America, Lady Cadogan's Illustrated Games of Solitaire or Patience appeared in 1914. Among more recent publications, The Complete book of Solitaire and Patience Games by Albert Morehead and Geoffrey Mott-Smith, first published in 1949, and still in print to this day, and David Parlett's Penguin Book of Patience are the most popular and authoritative references to solitaire games. Today, solitaire remains a beloved pastime for many people. It's requirements - a deck of cards, a flat surface, and a few rules - are simple enough that nearly anyone can play. Solitaire is a simple pleasure that harkens back to a time when the world was less complicated and hurried. Solitaire, whether played the old-fashioned way (by hand) or on the latest computer, is a great stress-reliever and mind exercise, more popular now than ever before. The History of Computer Solitaire When the first personal computer appeared, solitaire was a natural fit. Since the requirements for representing playing cards on a computer screen are rather modest, solitaire games proliferated. In the early days of MS-DOS, most solitaire games were text-mode, single-game programs. As the state of computer technologies advanced, graphics began to make the games look better, and larger memory capacity allowed programmers to fit more than one game into a single program, resulting in the solitaire collection. The first commercial solitaire collection was 'Solitaire Royale', written by Brad Fregger, published by Spectrum Holobyte in 1987, and available for both PC (MS-DOS) and Macintosh. It contained 8 different solitaire games, and featured 16-color EGA graphics and mouse support. A few years later, in 1992, QQP (Quantum Quality Productions) released a commercial collection called 'Solitaire's Journey', also for MS-DOS, featuring a mind-boggling 105 different games and comprehensive user statistics on each game. Players could also build their own custom 'journeys' by selecting a sub-set of the games, as well as compete in 'quests' to find treasure by successfully completing a sequence of solitaire games. On the shareware front,the largest shareware MS-DOS solitaire collection of the time was Solitaire Suite by Randy Rasa, released in 1991, which featured 7 solitaire games, EGA and mouse support. Microsoft Windows Solitaire first appeared in Windows 3.0 in 1990. This was actually an implementation of the classic 'Klondike' solitaire game, though the name 'Windows Solitaire' has been a source of confusion ever since. Windows 95, released to great fanfare in 1995, featured a solitaire game called Freecell, which soon became very popular, spawning a number of enhanced shareware versions of the game. Finally, Microsoft XP introduced Spider Solitaire, again inspiring a number of imitators and enhancers. In the last few years, the size of the shareware solitaire collections for Windows has simply exploded, led by Pretty Good Solitaire, Funsol Solitaire, and SolSuite, each of which now feature hundreds and hundreds of different solitaire games. On the Macintosh side, the leading collections include Solitaire Plus and Solitaire Till Dawn. Solitaires are also available for every conceivable computing platform, including PocketPC, PalmOS, Linux, and cell phones. Today, wherever you go, you'll find a solitaire ready and waiting to entertain you.",8,39.92,-2,2328,3,True,2017

The player's task is to properly accumulate resources and manage them in order to overcome the colony of the opponent. Buildings A feature of buildings in the game is that they can not be destroyed. Opponents can only destroy each other's units. Anthill The main building that is displayed on the game map before the game begins. The anthill of the enemy is located symmetrically with respect to the center of the map. You can not put an anthill too close to the center of the game screen and the edges. The collected resources of the ants are placed in an anthill, if there is no more close storehouse. All new ants also appear in an anthill. Laboratory After the construction of the laboratory, the study of the sciences and the training of soldiers becomes available. The laboratory is an extension to an anthill and does not require manual positioning. Stock The construction of warehouses can increase the rate of collection of resources. Workers and architects deliver the collected resources to the nearest warehouse, or to their anthill. In total it is possible to build five stocks. The warehouse can be built anywhere, but not too close to the growing resources. Units Ants are created using the buttons on the 'Build' panel. Work ants and Architects who do not participate in the collection of resources are displayed in the form of blinking spots on an anthill. Normally ants are not involved when there is no corresponding resource to collect, or they are outside the collection areas. - Worker Gathers food. Initially, you can create 40 worker ants and after the construction of each warehouse, this maximum is increased by another 15. Has one unit of health. - Architect Engaged in collecting wood. The maximum number of architects is the same as the maximum number of worker ants. - Warrior Designed to attack the enemy ants. The health of a warrior greatly exceeds the health of ants of other types and can be increased by studying the science of 'The Might of Warriors'. After studying the science of health, the already created soldiers do not increase. The maximum number of soldiers is not limited. The movement speed of ants when attacking an enemy increases by 30% compared to normal speed. Work ants and Architects slow their movement by dragging resources by 30%. Resources - Food Food grows from grains that appear after the growth of the previous group of plants and is collected by workers. If the food has stood untouched for a long time, then it turns into a wood. - Wood The wood is assembled by architects and is an indispensable resource for building a laboratory and warehouses, as well as for creating warriors and studying certain sciences. The wood appears from a long unassembled meal. To prevent workers from using food, you need to use the option 'forest area' in the 'order' panel. The food thickets chosen in this way will not be collected by workers. Advice Do not delay with the extraction of the wood - the earlier you accumulate the necessary amount for building a laboratory and warehouses, the more powerful your economy may be. Build warehouses in places of large accumulation of resources and away from an anthill - so your workers and architects will more effectively collect resources. If some resources are far from the delivery points, then you can clear or not create the collection zones in which they will be located until you build a warehouse nearby.

The Windows PC version of Marblesared can be played with keyboard (or gamepad) controlling the marble. How to play ? - Roll your red marble to the red goal, through mazes, obstacles &amp; bonuses. - Help a little yellow bean get to the yellow goal. The yellow bean can auto-navigate, and even has a jetpack for speeding to the yellow goal after your red marble unlocks it. HOWEVER Only your marble can help the bean reach that yellow goal. How? By lowering obstacles, by NOT tripping bad items, by NOT directly running over the bean and Smooshing it, and ideally, by doing it in as little time as possible if you are competitive and want to brag a bit :-) The target audience is early teens and older, due to the bean character being 'smooshed', and humour content (very bad puns), There is no elite skill barrier - anyone capable of using a Windows PC can play - albeit some better than others :-) Marblesared has been released in Steam as Early Access, and is incomplete but playable.

Background story In 194X, human created a new creature, which were combined with animals and tank components, called Beast Tanks. This new kind of creature had amazing power, they were controlled via radio waves. Beast Tanks can be used for agricultural production and other production activities, of course, including war. However, one day human suddenly lost control of the Beast Tanks. The runaway Beast Tanks conducted destruction everywhere in the whole world, brought the human being an unprecedented catastrophe... ... Metal Maidens are the only hope of the human being to defeat the Beast Tanks. Metal Maidens is the product of the Walküre Project, which aims to transform humans in a similar fashion to Beast Tanks; with the same capabilities or better. Metal Maiden technology is divided into two types -- Body modification and Attires. Body Modification --A Metal Maiden core (an improved Beast Tank core) is implanted into the body, vastly improving the human body's limits and expanding neural networks to allow for control of external armor and appendages. Attires -- Armored combat attires similar to a Beast Tank's, developed as a robust and reliable armor utilizing their new capabilities; however, some attires are specifically developed for and only correspond to a specific type of Metal Maiden core.

New enemies and maps will be released. Updates are free for those who already own the game. Bonny`s Adventure is a game that brings the basis of the classic platform games and several puzzles, making the game experience unique, harmoniously uniting the dynamics of adventure with the reflection of a good puzzle. History: In a far world, there’s an archipelago where magic controls the elements. Such place is inhabited by many animals in a small village. Their humble way of life brought a slow pace and peaceful way of life. However, according to a local legend, once there were bad times. More than a hundred years ago, Calundu the Wizard ruled the archipelago. In order to establish equilibrium, the ancient ones tell that a great war between the guardians who mastered the art of teleport and the powerful wizard Calundú took place. However, that was just a legend. One day, a mysterious storm with gales made the villagers take shelter. After the storm was gone, they noticed that the island was full of traps and that the Vulcan, named after Calundu, was active once again. That morning unravel the truth about the legend. Calundu was back. The villagers gathered to discuss how to stop Calundu, however more than a 100 years had passed and no guardian could have survived that long. The young armadillo always said that there was a guardian in the south islands, but none believed him. But, now this innocent soul was the only hope. In a courageous effort, Tuco went past many traps in his way to the south islands. After searching for some time, Tuco fell into a trap and faced death, but his guardian was there for him. Bonny saved Tuco. Tuco explained the situation, however Bonny had not used his powers for a long time. Tuco insisted that only Bonny could save the archipelago. Finally, Bonny agreed to help and Tuco took him back to the village. The villagers were marveled by Bonny’s presence and decided to help as much as they could. Local lumberjack, Beaver, gave Bonny a little wooden helmet for protection. The father of many, as the Bunny was known, gave Bonny an iron helmet covered with fur to warm up Bonny. Tuco’s parents, who were farmers, could not help because the storm took away their carrots and cherries. Bonny was grateful to the villagers , gave then a warm hug and left for his journey towards Calundú’s island.",12,47.88,10,2441,0,True,2017

Connect blocks in a line or diagonally as long as they touch. Blocks groups of the same color also need to be 'activated' by a direct hit. This allows for strategic hoarding of blocks to increase score and gain extra move turns. * Some Playing Tips * Activations can be made by any color block. e.g. A blue block can hit and activate a group of orange blocks A block going from left to right across the board will attach to other blocks in its path providing there is a space for it Placing blocks next to each other in a large group without activating will allow you to group up 5+ blocks Blocks can be grouped if they touch side by side or diagonally RELEASING BLOCKS Clicking the activators around the board perimeter releases a block. Hold down the mouse to see the direction line of the block. The block displayed below the board area is the current block that will be released. Clear the screen to advance to the next level. The game plays with relaxing music to create a calming and enjoyable gaming experience and also comes with a Learning mode . There are 3 modes of play currently... 1. LEVEL MODE : Level progression, where player must advance through puzzle levels that increase in difficulty, using a limited amount of moves and your brain. Players can take their time choosing their next move. 2. TIMER MODE : The second play mode is one that produces procedural levels that increase in difficultly along with a countdown timer. Win extra time by activating 5+ blocks together. This requires fast thinking to advance to the next level. You need to keep a clear head and remain calm to advance far on the timer play mode. This mode is not relaxing unless you get into the zone and feel as one with the blocks. :) 3. ARCADE MODE : Starts slowly, but as time passes more blocks emerge on the board to clear away. The blocks are released from the heavens by the spirits that float around your screen.

Build yourself from components found or salvaged from other robots. Attach power sources, propulsion units, utilities, and weapons to become a slow tank bristling with weapons, or a fast-moving flier zipping past enemies before they even have time to react, or a stealthy sword-wielding assassin/hacker, or whatever else you can come up with from the salvage you find. The situation can quickly change as you lose components and rebuild yourself from enemy remains. You are the Cogmind. Discover what that means as you explore a living, breathing world ruled by robots. KEY FEATURES Build and modify a unique robot from parts found, or enemies defeated Dynamic character development without XP/grinding Dozens of robot classes, each with unique behavior within the ecosystem Procedurally generated world combined with hand-crafted content Nine different animated endings to uncover ASCII evolved: Most advanced terminal interface ever Thousands of particle effects and SFX Fully destructible environment PROGRESS Although currently in Early Access, Cogmind is mostly complete. There are over two-dozen map types, nearly a thousand items, thousands of sound and particle effects, multiple plot lines, hundreds of hand-made locations and encounters, thousands of lines of dialogue, and nine different animated endings to discover. That said, there are many plans to continue expanding the world with features and content, so for now we'll just call it EA :D (Cogmind has been in full-time development for over six years.)        ROGUELIKE? Cogmind is a turn-based roguelike, very traditional in many ways (permadeath procedural dungeon crawler built with ASCII in mind...), but at the same time innovates on the genre in terms of both design and accessibility features. Within you have full mouse control--and full keyboard control! Use only one or the other, or both, and all common roguelike movement methods (mouse, numpad, vi, arrows) are enabled out of the box, no configuration required. Mouse users get drag-and-drop inventory management, and the keyboard is even faster with its multiple command schemes and built-in automation features. Stealth play is just as viable as straightforward combat, using hacking and information warfare to outsmart the Complex. The lack of an XP system means you only have to use whatever means you can to reach new areas and find new gear to advance. The world is alive with many types of robots, most of which are actually not hostile to you and have their own duties to carry out. Map objects are labeled as they come into view, making for less tedious play and allowing you to instead focus on tactics and survival. A large number of other options and useful features are available to customize the UI. While the most skilled players can reliably win the default mode, easier difficulty settings are available for those with less experience, or less time on their hands :) (advanced players can also attempt to take on the extended end-game!) Accumulate knowledge across multiple plays, collecting info about previously used items in the ASCII art gallery (over 900 pieces of art!), and collecting lore about the world as you discover its inhabitants and guess at their potential motives, and true capabilities. While there's a rich story to uncover over many runs, know that it doesn't get in the way if you prefer to just strategize and min-max through your roguelikes. Take on built-in Challenge Modes for a different kind of experience, or to prove just how good you really are. WARNINGS Not every game is for everyone, so there are a few things to point out that may affect your interest in Cogmind. No Hand-holding: Although very accessible and there's both context help and a quick tutorial to teach all the fundamentals, Cogmind invites you to explore a completely unfamiliar world. Observant players will come to internalize many of that world's rules naturally, and as you reach new areas you'll also discover in-theme explanations for everything , seamlessly integrated with the lore. As part of that process you'll often be faced with the post-death challenge of figuring out where things went wrong and why, until you eventually reach a point where you can see danger before it even materializes. Rampant Item Destruction: Every item in Cogmind can be destroyed, and many of your items will be destroyed. At first this may be discouraging, but once you figure out the basics you'll generally be replacing old and broken parts with much better loot even before you lose it anyway. Building and, more importantly, rebuilding , is a vital part of the experience and what keeps the game dynamic and interesting throughout. Adaptability is key, and amazing comebacks are commonplace. No Classes, Skills, Etc.: Unlike many other roguelikes and CRPGs in which you may form a sort of attachment to your character class and the levels, stats, skills, and equipment they've acquired over time, Cogmind is defined almost purely by items . And as mentioned those items will be destroyed, so there's not much chance to form that kind of attachment. However, this also leaves room for great flexibility during a single playthrough, flexibility you might want or need to rely on to maximize your chances for survival depending on what locations you visit. A Different Kind of Game: As a whole Cogmind is quite different from pretty much everything out there, a fact that turns some people off, but others rather enjoy it for that same reason. It can also take a little while to get into, but once past learning the basics and how to reliably overcome early-game areas, the world and its opportunities really open up. Not Suitable for Small Screens: Due to the game design, the screen is always divided into a minimum of 80x60 spaces that make up the 'terminal grid.' This means when played on a physically small screen, such as that of a laptop, each space will be relatively small and some players could have trouble comfortably seeing the details. Zooming is not supported by the engine. You can test what Cogmind will look like on your screen of choice here: (Note that ASCII mode is easier to see at smaller sizes, but it's understandable that three-quarters of players prefer the default tiles mode anyway :P)",1272,25427.28,1163,2267,256,True,2017

In Willy-Nilly Knight you have to be a knight in the middle of strange and unpredictable events. If you want to find out the truth, then you should do your best in fighting and tactics. At least it's a tactical RPG. What should you expect from Willy-Nilly Knight? It's a great story. It takes place in a wonderful world. You will meet many attractive NPCs and build friendships with them. You will master a unique tactical battle system and crafting. And it's just the tip of the iceberg. Really. Exciting adventure of the true hero: You will be a vital part of the great adventure and witness many different things. Do you want an example? What about confrontation with Gods? Or do you want to be a part of English folklore? Anyway, this journey will last more than 20 hours of gameplay so there will be plenty of events for sure. It's real-time and turn-based all in one: You could discover points of interest in this world in real time. But then it's time to fight game switches in turn-based mode. So you could keep your pace and plan your action carefully. Your action points is your only restriction there. Surprises and references: There are so many surprises and references... Could you catch 'em all? Friends Will Be Friends: In this journey you will meet many different characters. Some of them will be your enemies, but you could find friends too. Even a true love! All your companions will have unique skill-set so it's your right to choose with whom you want to be on one side. Real handyman: There are so many useful things in Willy-Nilly Knight… Armours, helms, boots, gloves, weapons, scrolls, potions. You could buy it. You could loot it. You could craft it!

Easy Mode added to the game (if you love retro games, you'll know the code already). Added a special stage for Schwer-Muta, needs a special code to active. All new codes need to be inputted during the Introduction Screen. Please note that some of the codes/modes will disable the Replay function. Acheivements! Rosenkreuzstilette is an action-platformer game in which you step into the shoes of Spiritia Rosenberg, a virtuous young woman caught on the wrong side of a revolution instigated by her closest friends. Each of the game's seventeen stages is filled with treacherous terrain and swarms of enemies ready to make quick work of our plucky young heroine. Guide Spiritia safely to the boss at the end of each stage and use all of the abilities at your disposal to knock some sense into them. Upon defeating a boss for the first time, Spiritia may acquire a new magical ability or two. There are plenty of unique abilities scattered throughout the game, and some of them can make particularly troublesome areas much easier to navigate. Each boss is especially vulnerable to certain abilities, so learning to pinpoint and exploit these weaknesses is bound to make defeating them a lot less painful (for you, not them). Having recently completed a six-month-long teaching assignment for the Holy Empire, Spiritia Rosenberg was anxious to return home to her friends and get some well-deserved rest. Unfortunately, her homecoming would not be the warm welcome she had expected. As Spiritia returned to the Imperial Training Grounds, a monstrous dragon appeared and whisked away her student Iris, the daughter of the esteemed Count Michael Zeppelin. Moments later, flames engulfed the training grounds and its surroundings, ruthlessly consuming everything in their wake. With no time to lose, Spiritia and her fairy companion Lilli rushed into the burning forest in pursuit. Making her way through the roaring flames, Spiritia was overjoyed to find her best friend, the cool and collected Freudia Neuwahl, already on the scene. However, her joy quickly turned to horror as she learned the identity of the arsonists; her own organization of magicians, Rosenkreuzstilette, with Freudia herself leading the assault. Freudia informed Spiritia of the unit's decision to rise against the injustices fostered by the Empire, inviting her to rejoin their comrades as they declared war on mankind. Not one to tolerate the suffering of innocents, Spiritia refused - and vowed to stop her comrades from making a senseless and deadly mistake. Join Spiritia in her quest to stop Rosenkreuzstilette, a company of rogue magicians led by Count Zeppelin himself. A squad composed entirely of Spiritia's dearest friends... - Our Heroines - The Blades of the Rose Cross (Rosenkreuzstilette) A digital manual containing all of the information below (and more) can be found in the game's installation folder.

The goal of the game is to find and match all identical cats on the board. The tiles are flipped over so you can only see their backs. Depending on the difficulty level you can flip 2, 3, 4 or 5 tiles at a time. If the revealed cats are identical, the tiles are claimed and your score increases. Otherwise, the tiles are flipped back and you can continue flipping up other tiles. When you claim all the tiles on a board, you may get bonus points if you have been quick enough and haven’t made too many attempts while matching the tiles. You will then move on to a larger board, so your memory is challenged even more! Select flipped or claimed tiles to reveal a full screen image with the cat’s name, their favorite quote and a special information (i.e. Patience, Monster or Psychedelic Mood status.) Cats Make Your Smarter! offers 5 game modes which all share basic game concepts and also have their own special variations and twists. #1: Sleepy Kitty Other than the time limit, you are free to flip the tiles as many times as you need, so this is the classic memory game you might be familiar with already. This game mode is ideal for beginners, or when you are a bit tired. #2: Good Luck, Jerry! Here each cat has a number of Patience points. When the flipped tiles are not matched, each flipped tile loses a Patience point. When a flipped tile has only 1 Patience point left, it gains a red border as a reminder for you to be cautious with it. Once a tile runs out of its Patience, it becomes a Trouble tile. A Trouble tile’s background is all red. If you flip such a tile, and it’s not a match, each of the flipped Trouble tiles will move randomly, pushing tiles around the board. As the tiles move around it will be harder to remember each tile’s position, so try not to annoy the cats – although annoyed cats give you better score! #3: Jones of Nostromo In this game mode the cats have less Patience points. Moreover, one of the cats – the Monster – starts with 0 Patience points. And, if this weren’t dangerous enough already, as a special rule, you can only match the Monster tiles last, after you have matched all others on the board. A Monster tile behaves like a Trouble tile, so avoid them! #4: Nyan-Nyan Ninja This game mode tests your reflexes as well as your ability to recognize patterns. The tiles are laid out on the board without being flipped, but you only have a very limited time to select the identical tiles. You get some extra time after each successful match, but if you accidentally select cats which aren’t identical, your time gets halved immediately, so be very careful! #5: Mr. Bigglesworth Sends His Regards The cats are having a party and feeling a bit psychedelic, thus finding matches will be a lot harder in this happy chaos. Each cat have 0 Patience points, so if you cannot match them, they will wander around just like as if they were Trouble tiles. As cats are so impatient here but also very curious, each flipped tile’s immediate neighbors will also be flipped – for free – which allows you to memorize up to 9 tiles for each flipped tile. The cats also choose a randomly picked color for themselves each time you flip them, so don’t be fooled by this trickery: try to ignore the colors and concentrate only on the cats!",156,0.0,132,2264,50,True,2017

There are simply no limits to the carnage you can achieve in Epic Battle Simulator. Mess around with a massive variety of units. Everything from, Roman Centurions, Medieval soldiers, Knights, Orcs, Trolls, and yes, chickens! The main focus in this game is giving the player no restrictions to what he can do.

On top of that, you can play as any one of the units in the game, getting up close and personal to help change the tides of a massive battle, while rallying teammates and giving them orders! The Technology: Unfortunately there really aren't many engines that you can chuck 10,000 characters in and expect good performance. This is why I worked months on end to create the most powerful crowd rendering system ever conceived in Unity engine. The detail of each character has little effect on performance while each individual acts independently, but is working towards a greater good for his team. Each individual decides his own path and navigates complex environments. But I didn't stop there! With the large open environments, I needed a more dynamic lighting solution than the one built in to Unity engine. So I built my own dynamic global illumination lighting engine. This enables bounce light completely in real time. What does that mean? That means every piece of shiny armor is reflecting it's true surroundings, every bright surfaces illuminates it's surroundings and effects the overall lighting.

Excellent voice acting from the famous Czech actor Jíří Lábus. / Story Severin is a young monk, who was sound sleeping, while some claustral disciples were disporting with adult literature. When he awakes and actually takes the erotic scripture from the boys, he himself is accused by his abbot of the worst sins. The abbot doesn't hesitate long - we are in the dark Middle Ages - trying to behead the 'devil's minion'.

Your task is to discover powerful cards, build your deck and enter battle with the sinister creatures of Aea. During your adventure, you will engage in a challenging loop of battling new enemies, developing fresh tactics, evolving your cards and re-tuning your decks to achieve victory. DECK BUILDING AND BATTLES Skillful deck building is crucial in Cabals: Card Blitz . The game features a wide array of stunning, HAND PAINTED CARDS to collect, each with their own unique powers and abilities. You’ll need to choose the right combination of cards to defeat different opponents, who all have their own battle strategies. In battle, your cards are drawn automatically and face off against the enemy cards, introducing an exciting chance factor into a skill-based game. After a first battle, you’ll know your enemy’s deck. What’s the probability you should beat it with the correct combination of cards? How many battles should it take you to win? Thanks to the speed slider in battle, you’re in control of how quickly the action happens. Crank it up to maximum for SUPER-FAST 30 SECOND BATTLES, or take it slower to focus on the abilities of your opponent. If you lose a battle, it’s back to the Deck Editor to re-tune your deck for a different strategy, and then leap back into the action. As you collect more cards you’ll use the Anvil to evolve them, creating more powerful versions of your cards. And once you’ve unlocked CARD FUSION, your options expand dramatically, with super powerful new cards to be forged. SINGLE PLAYER AND MULTIPLAYER MODES Cabals: Card Blitz features a rich, single-player adventure mode alongside an instant multiplayer mode. Whether you want to focus on exploring Aea and discovering new cards or on taking on other players in PvP battles is entirely up to you. In the single player mode, you will explore a map of the alternate world of Aea, a vast realm of scorching deserts, icy plains and lethal rain forests. You choose your own path through this world, unlocking new regions by completing battles. You can also conquer strongholds, which will generate daily rewards for you in the form of gold, new cards, and valuable gems. As you proceed through Aea the battles become progressively tougher, ensuring you always have a challenge to face. The player versus player mode sits right alongside single player, so your deck and characters can be used in both. PvP mode in Cabals: Card Blitz is designed to guarantee you always have opponents to face, as you can play against offline rivals. This means NO WAITING around in lobbies for invitations to be accepted, or disappointment if other players drop out of battle halfway through. PvP mode is a great way to test out your deck, earn gold, and climb the leaderboard. And, if another player challenges your deck and you win, you pick up rewards as well! WHO IS THE GAME FOR? • CCG PLAYERS who enjoy the challenge of learning about card abilities and building powerful decks • RPG PLAYERS who relish levelling up their characters and fighting weird creatures • ADVENTURE GAMERS who love exploring unique universes and appreciate beautiful artwork • MULTITASKERS!

If you want to take a screenshot using Steam Overlay feature, please change the key to the key other than F12. F12: Reset the game Alt+Enter: Full screen / Window mode ―――A story of revenge. The demon Yukie has subjected the world to an Eternal Winter, feeding off the lives of humans for countless years. The First Man was drawn from the world of story by Yukie. They fell in love, but one day the man disappeared, and Yukie fell into madness, thriving in an eternal winter. Yukie's children all have blue eyes, proof of their lineage. It is a fragment of their mother's power of the snow. Those men who possessed power unknown to mankind were burdened with the fate of killing Yukie. ...But every one of them fell defeated before her. Our hero, Yukiji, is the youngest heir to that lineage. The final avenger of this world. Ready your blade, and make your way to the mountain where Yukie resides. Yukiji: The last descendant of the family that fell in love with Yukie, and the hero of our tale. Yukie: The beautiful snow maiden who thrives in an Eternal Winter. Tetsuji: The father who constantly ran from his destined fight. Village Chief: The leader of a village cursed by the Eternal Winter. Piece together the story as you journey through each chapter. At the end of each chapter, an event will occur. Shingan (standard attack): Listen out for the sound of your enemy and press confirm as soon as you hear them. *You should play in an environment where you can hear the game's sound. Records: You can save while walking or at the map screen. Voiceover: Voices can be toggled on/off upon starting a new game or from the map screen. Developer's Voice This is a theatrical story game. Lead the hero Yukiji on a journey of vengeance, to the snowy mountain where Yukie resides. The story will proceed in a movie-like fashion. We are proud to say the game is fully voiced (voiceover can be turned ON/OFF). Message from the publisher Hi, I’m Hugo and I manage localization at Playism. I fell in love with YUKIE on my first playthrough and am thrilled to say the game is finally available in English! An Eternal Winter reigns over the land. Yukiji, a young warrior is determined to end this and avenge his forefathers by slaying the beautiful demon Yukie. A traditional fairytale that seems like it could have just popped out of Japanese folklore. But what makes YUKIE stand out to me among narrative-based games is how well the sum of its parts – such as the art, musical score and writing – fit together so well as a whole, to create the captivating atmosphere of Yukie’s cursed yet beautiful winterland. Apart from the text playing a major role in any story game, it was important for us to preserve the poetic phrasing and classic writing style of the tale. For this we enlisted the help of Timothy Borreson who took great care to keep the essence of the original Japanese text. He has worked on titles such as Brave Frontier, Armored Hunter Gunhound EX, Artifact Adventure and its upcoming sequel Artifact Adventure Gaiden. On their path to revenge the player will encounter wolves, crows and legendary beasts that are hostile towards Yukiji and will have to fight their way out of these situations. To attack or defend, the key must be pressed the exact moment they hear the enemy approaching. Yukiji will also gain new powers along his journey, to help him in and out of the field.

You are in control of the planet's weather, but you do not have control of the planet's life. Everything you do affects any plants, animals or even people that develop on your world. A storm may bring much needed cool rain, but it could also scare inhabitants or kill life if it is too strong. In You Are God, you [the player] must care for a new planet. Warm the planet with sunlight and wet it down with rain to produce the best conditions for life to develop. If the conditions are right, plant life may develop. If there is plant life, it's possible that animal life may form. Once there is animal life, it may develop sentience. Once this happens the lifeforms will create a new religion to offer solace to their fears and desires. Will they worship you, or will they come up with a different God? Will the different nations turn on each other, fighting over which religion is correct, or will they unite in harmony and develop new technologies together? Will they become advanced enough to journey into space and potentially leave the planet entirely? They will live their lives, following their own free will, but you must guide them and care for them if they are to reach their full potential. There are three continents (nations) that grow and run by their own sets of rules. These rules are dictated by the religion they design and follow. If you are the God they worship, you will have more influence over them, but you can never control them. If you are unknown or despised by the people they may turn against you. If the nations have different Gods, they may fight and could even destroy the planet in the process. The endgame idea is for the people on the planet to discover another world and leave their home planet behind. As the technology level rises, the people will notice the stars, go to space, colonize the moon, research other planets and eventually leave to colonize on another world.

Find out if you have the right stuff to get on (and stay on) the Rocket Blasters Steam Leaderboards! Unique Scoring System Rocket Blasters has a unique system that rewards precision and restraint while blowing stuff up. Each time you fire your weapon, you lose a point, that's right, you lose a point for shooting. However, each time you hit something, you will get 2 or more points back, depending on what you hit. Spamming bullets may be easier, but it will not get you the high score. Check your score on the Steam Global Leader Boards! The Dread Pizza Armada in all its glory Enemies Asteroids are not the only obstacle your rocket will encounter along the way. The Dread Pizza Armada is planning an attack on Earth, and you must destroy as many of their drones as possible. Drones You will encounter many of these dangerous robot ships on your journey. Avoid them, and their lasers, or suffer a painful demise. Shooting them will earn you more points than blasting asteroids, so thinking strategically about what you shoot will help you raise your score. Pizza Armada Battleships The Dread Pizza Armada was named after these oddly shaped triangular battleships. Be careful of lingering behind them, as they have a dangerous array of lasers aimed right at you! Colossal Dreadnoughts The Colossal Dreadnought is the rarest and most dangerous ship in the Armada. Huge and heavily armored, your rocket will have to be quick to avoid its dreaded Annihilation Beam, which destroys everything in its path, including asteroids, your rocket and even its own drones. Finding its weak spot will be key in overcoming this deadly foe. Battling a Pizza Armada Dreadnought Upgrades Your rocket starts with a simple laser blaster, however, as you progress through the game, you may find some useful, temporary upgrades along the way. Look for the floating upgrade gear, and simply fly into it in order to upgrade your rocket. Upgrades have a time limit, indicated by the numbers that appear above your rocket on the screen. Triple Blasters Two extra lasers allow you to clear a path through obstacles and enemies much more efficiently than the single cannon you start with. Side Cannons Side Cannons allow you to slip past enemies and dangers, while giving you the power to blast them out of space from the side. This allows for a very different, strategic approach when confronting enemies. Energy Shield The Energy Shield is a very powerful upgrade, making your rocket completely impervious to all dangers for a short time. Be careful of the timer though, it is quite inconvenient when you lose the shield in the middle of a battle.

The game allows you to search for fast duels with anyone or duel the IA in several rounds to decide who wins and who losses. There are several characters available, different weapons to use and even additional modes that let you practice your aim through different types of challenges (such as shooting cans in your ranch). But none of that accurately describes the best of Unforgiven VR: the thrill of facing another player knowing that only one of you can win… and the other one will die. Select one of the available characters and start your journey in the wild west. -- A new character is coming to the town every few weeks -- Dueling is hard and dangerous, not everyone is gifted with the ability to shoot a weapon, but practise makes perfection and in the training field you will be able to shoot some objects to tune your aim before challenging someone. We divided our development in different stages grouping features. To be playable some of the early stages will have temporary systems that will be replaced with the final ones when all the pieces are there. Next you can find an approximation of what will include every stage: Stage 1: Any Gun Can Play You will be able to select one of the 4 characters and challenge other online people or the AI to duel on 1 scenario and score for a leaderboard based on your win/loss ratio. Do you need to improve your aim? No problem, you can go to the training area to practise. Stage 2: The Saloon opens its doors Tired of shooting your friends? Take a break in the saloon, play poker with other people or join a knife throwing game while you wait for someone to duel you. The training area will be enhanced with challenges like “shoot three times in the air that can”. What you want more shooting? No problem, there will be new characters and scenarios to play with. Stage 3: Become a legend of the wild west Forget about the old leaderboard. Now you will have to create a character and start your journey to become a true legend. Duel someone for a fistfull of dollars, but be careful, now you can get hurt or even die, and it will mean to lose your character and creating a new one. Ah, and remember, now your ammo will deplete, go to the general store and buy some more. As usual, new characters, weapons and scenarios will come with a enhanced saloon with more places to interact with. Stage 4: The Town becomes a city Dress like a sir, die like the rest, more aesthetic and gameplay complements, you know, a good flask in the pocket could stop a bullet. But be cautious, being hurt in a duel will make easier to be killed in the next, take a break to restore your health or… visit the barber and it will fix you up in a minute… for a price. Not the only new pal in the city, new characters will come and a new NPC, the undertaker, that will immortalize you in the Valley of Crosses. Last but not least, sometimes we will be able to find special cards that will come with item drops. Extra Stage: Magnificent 7 Group with your friends for the ultimate dueling experience.

Yes, you read correctly. Our teams (me and myself) worked hard to offer Xploquest on Windows, Mac and Linux. But what is Xploquest? Xploquest has all the features of indie game: It’s ugly but with a lot of charm It’s cheap It’s played like an old game but with a current interface It’s done with love What else?

You explore the world freely and discover new places, dungeons and caves. Okay, but what are the real assets? Ok you want something concrete: It’s hard, the game only saves when you're in a city. If you explore without being ready, you may die very quickly. No tiresome scenario, endless dialogs with tasteless NPCs. In Xploquest, you are alone, you do what you want, as you want. A clear quest system. When you accept a quest, it appears on the map. (xploquest 2) Perfect for both long and short game sessions. You can give up Xploquest for weeks and come back without wondering what to do. In addition, the game will not blame you for this absence. You can play other RPG at the same time.

The difference with others is that you can spend it. Whether it's equipment, skills, food, potions or scrolls, you'll have to pay. Fights only bring in experience and gold, the chess contain gold (and maybe something else for some. No more depressed to have millions of gold coins without being able to spend them. In Xploquest, managing your gold is a very important aspect of the game. I am convinced. Last question: is there a goal? Yes the game ends when you have explored all the floors of the tower. For this you will have to find the 10 keys that will unlock each floor. It's perfect. The final word ? It's free, guaranteed without advertising and without in-app purchase.

All children learn differently and puzzles may be their medium for grasping an understanding of certain themes such as alphabet letters. PROBLEM SOLVING: Completing a puzzle, even the most simplest of puzzles sets a single goal to achieve. Toddlers and children must think and develop strategies on how to approach in achieving this goal. This process involves problem solving, reasoning skills and developing solutions which they can later be transferred into their personal/adult life. FINE MOTOR DEVELOPMENT: Puzzles are a fun way for children to develop and refine their fine motor skills. When engaged in playing with puzzles, children are required to pick up, pinch and grasp pieces (some with small knobs, pegs or chunky pieces) and move them around, manipulating them into slots, sorting them and fitting them into the correct places. HAND AND EYE COORDINATION: Playing with puzzles requires a trial and error process which involves a lot of hand and eye manipulation. For example, as a toddler or child places a piece of the puzzle that does not fit, they will try all over again where their actions involve doing what they actually see. SOCIAL: Puzzles are a great educational tool to enhance and promote cooperative play. As kids work together to complete a puzzle, they will discuss where a piece should go and why, take turns and share and support each other when handling frustration, then sharing the joy of finishing the puzzle. SELF ESTEEM: The accomplishment of achieving a goal brings so much satisfaction to a child.

You like innovative puzzle games. The main idea of YAPP is to make a game full of WOW moments. In most puzzle games, if the game gives you a box, you simply push it somewhere and jump onto it. In YAPP, a box can interact with your two abilities in different ways. In one of the levels you place the box onto your clone and jump onto the box to get higher, later you place your clone onto the box, grab the box and jump, then teleport to your clone and jump again to make a double jump. In another level, you place your clone at the edge of a high ground, grab the box at a lower place and jump and teleport immediately and grab the box which 'jumped' with you. . 2. You like challenging puzzle games. Within the scope of my knowledge, it is one of the most challenging puzzle platformers ever made. (Not one of the most challenging puzzle games. At least it's easier than Stephen's Sausage Roll.) 3. You have played one or two platformers before.

Note that if you already own on Steam some of the scenarios in the base pack, they will not be charged again. WAW is a unique strategy turn-based game concept, on a boardgame spirit, which aims at simulating in one single system ALL conflicts throughout the world (and beyond) from Prehistoric times to nowadays, from grand massive wars to asymmetrical conflicts. And it will work also on non-historical, alternate history, fantastic or SF titles. The key is the use of a single system of rules and situations which works in all cases. Why? Because we want players to learn rules only once, get confident and at ease with them, and then spend all their time with the titles in the collection in a speedy and effortless manner ... for example, the battle screen will be similar throughout the games, and thus will require almost no adaptation for enjoying it in a new game! Practically, a few minutes are required to read about the specific properties and content of a new scenario and you can jump right in! The Main Game Features includes: Game is turn-based, using the I GO U GO system, each player taking one side (sides involve sometimes more than one nation). The map is divided into numerous regions, with various terrains and sometimes structures (ports, fortresses, airports ...), and potentially sources of income when necessary. When maintenance and purchase of forces is needed, or to acquire new event cards, a simple income system is activated. Combat units may be from the land, naval or air domains. You will find different types, such as infantry, cavalry, artillery, guerrillas, submarines, flat tops, fighters, elephants, anti-aircraft batteries, etc ... All of which can be combined into different stacks for easy handling. Leaders are crucial in the game, as they have three main usages: first they give bonus to the base combat values of their stacks, second their morale values are use to check victory or defeat levels, and lastly they are necessary to launch attacks on the enemy. Two opposing stacks in the same region generate a battle, which is resolved in a semi-tactical way in two successive rounds. The game automatically calculates the various bonus and penalties of sides, their respective morale levels, allows for event cards play, and they each combat unit of each side shoots simultaneously (in most cases) at the enemy. Losses are taken in terms of hits and panics. The moral level of the initial army affected by the losses and panics suffered, which in turn may lead to rout, pursuit and breakthroughs. Multiple Events Cards packs are granted to each side, that they will use to influence all aspects of the game, such as alliances, income, movement, weather, leadership, number and quality of troops and finally many tactical aspects for the battles. This ensures both a real uncertainty in the game and a great replayability potential.    The scale changes according to scenarios. A ground combat unit could be only a simple battalion or a whole army. A region may represent a few square miles or a whole country. And similarly, a game turn could be just a few hours or up to many years! Game allows for coverage of different ‘spaces’ of play, such as land, sea, air or outer space…!   PLANNING Each month, a new scenario will be released!    The WAW base pack , contains the game engine , the tutorial and 10 different scenarios (and can make use of all future DLCs and packs): HAMILKAR 264, the long First Punic War, the first Rome vs. Carthage war.

So I remembered the dream and thought it was a love story of the world..... But when I saw the story again, I found that it couldn't be any more common, and why was it that I was so unhappy and annoyed?! I don't understand... After that, it took root in my heart like a seed. The longer it grew, the more I grew unhappy...... Then I found that I regret only exist in my actor dream, when I woke up I'll no longer be a hero, so this love story will become intense darkness without light in my eyes.

The game has 3 difficulty levels: Easy, Medium and Difficult, as well as 3 modes of play: 'Defence', 'Wave' and 'Survive' In the mode 'Defence' you have to protect your pumpkins for 3 minutes from the hungry, but funny zombies. In the mode 'Wave', as well as in the 'Defence' mode, you protect your pumpkins from the zombies, but now you have to survive 3 waves of zombies for 5 minutes, the number of zombies increases in each successive wave. In the mode 'Survive' zombies are attacking you - hang on for 3 minutes and fend off the zombies with the help of bullets and a strong butt. The game is available in two levels of 'Farm' and 'City', to start the level - shoot the screen where it is displayed. On the easy level of difficulty in the mode of 'Defence' and 'Wave', you need to protect 6 pumpkins from pumpkin-eating zombies, on the average - 4 and on the difficult - 2 pumpkins respectively. In the 'Survival' mode the number of attacking you zombies will increase upon increasing the levels of difficulty. The game has different weapons, which can be unlocked for credits. To select a weapon, if it is available to you, shoot the target that appears under the weapon. Not all the weapons are equally effective in different modes! Choose the weapons individually for a specific mode. For example, a gun will be less effective in 'Survival' than a shotgun. And the shotgun, in turn, is less effective in 'Defence' mode. With Akimbo you will feel comfortable in almost any mode! Each weapon has its specific type of damage when hits in the head or body. Each weapon has its own bullets spread, accuracy, reloading speed and shooting, as well as ammunition. You'll get more points and credits in more complicated modes (such as 'Survival'), and at the higher levels of difficulty. In the 'Survival' mode, at the highest level of difficulty, you can get the maximum number of points and credits. But there is one nuance, you do not get points and credits for killing zombies with the bare hands - use your weapon! Also do not forget the birds - they bring more points than the zombies! You will receive your points and credits only if you win the round - at a loss the points and credits are not charged! For your credits you can unlock new weapons in the Main Menu, for using it afterwards in the game. Tactics is everything for us! In the 'Defence' mode, sometimes it is more profitable to give a pumpkin to one zombie for shooting then all the zombies that will pass by you! Do not forget to recharge on time, on every moment: sometimes the correct recharge can decide the outcome of the round. Use the weapons at its destination - it makes no sense to fire a shotgun at a target which is far away from you, only if it is not a 'Crusher' in your hands, of course! Or it makes no sense to try to play the 'Survival' at a high level of difficulty with a gun, if, of course, you're planning to win. Use a few seconds at the beginning of each round, when the time had already started, but the zombies have not appeared yet, to shoot as many birds as possible, because during the attack of zombies it is much more difficult to do it!

Feature list fast arcade style 'find the matching tile' game two game modes: arcade and 'chill' mode 60 levels + various bonus maps 3 different bonus level types: fill the board, spot the match, find the match three relaxing sound tracks Steam Leaderboard 8 unlock-able achievements Rules Clear the board by finding two items with identical symbols. The tiles will disappear when you can 'connect' them with a line, which has two or less corners ( right angles ) in it and no other part is blocking the way. Advance to the next level by clearing the board. If you run out of time before you finish a map, you lose. A map can contain tiles in up to 3 layers. You might combine tiles of different layers. If you pick one tile from the top layer and one from the bottom layer, only tiles on the top layer block the way. In general: if you pick items from different layers, the upper most selected items layer is used for the search algorithm. Sounds difficult but if you give it a try, you will figure in no time... ;) Tiles with the same symbol might be located on top of each other. So the fastest pick is not always the best. Bonus Level Every 3rd level you play is a bonus level. There are three different types of bonus level: 1.) You start with 4 tiles and have to fill up the map. Every time you remove a pair, 4 new tiles will appear. 2.) Two visible tiles swap its places quickly for several times. Spot the last position. 3.) Classic 'find a matching pair' on the turned deck. If you manage to complete a bonus level, you receive a 100 point bonus. If the time runs out, you advance to the next level. After finishing a bonus level you receive an extra Hint-Item ( see below ). If you are not up for bonuses, you can skip the bonus level. Special Items Solid Tiles Solid tiles cannot be removed. Yin Yang If you pick a pair of Yin Yang the next picked symbol will disappear from the current map. If the Yin Yang is the last pair you pick, you can use this special on the next map. Time Bonus Item From time to time animated hourglasses appear on a symbol for a few seconds. If you manage to remove this item you receive 15 extra seconds. Hint Item If you need a hint during the game, tap the Hint Item. If available, a matching pair will be selected. It will disappear if you tap on it. After finishing a Bonus Level you receive an extra Hint Item. You can collect up to 3 Hint Items. Scoring The first successful pick scores 0 points. The next pick within 3 seconds, scores 4 points, within 5 seconds 2 point. After finishing a level, the remaining time is added to you score.

18532,Spellgear,2017-04-07,0.0,0,SkyRiver Studios,SkyRiver Studios,"Action,Indie,RPG","SpellGear is an exciting action role-playing game with a unique combat system, an Open World, perilous Crusades, and engaging Arenas where players can test their mettle. The battle system of SpellGear is “non-target”, which means the game doesn’t automatically target your enemies for you. You set the direction of your attack yourself, and a successful strike depends entirely on your accuracy and skills. Also the game implements somersaults, blocking moves, and the ability to repulse enemies, helping you avoid damage and survive the most difficult of combat situations. Another distinguishing feature of the SpellGear combat system is how weapons and equipment don’t bind specifically to players. For example, say you’re playing a game as a melee fighter, and you suddenly regret that you don’t have a bow to nail that half-dead scoundrel trying to get away… But there’s someone right there who has a bow—ah, but they can’t give it to you as it’s bound to them. Instead of cursing your luck and arbitrary binding game traits, we allow you to not just replace and trade your weapons with other players, but you can even do it in the heat of combat! Not only that, but you’ll be able to gain more skills with a range of weapons, allowing for you to craft all manner of interesting character builds. We feel this “Unbound” mechanic really helps round out Spellgear, and it makes your game experience truly dynamic and as hardcore as you want it to be. SpellGear also offers several kinds of arenas with a variety of gameplay. There are a number of modified MOBA arenas, such as Domination, Team Deathmatch, and Capture the Flag. We also provide MOBA arenas with classic and awesome elements like Towers, Minions, and Bases. You can also dive into a more traditionally styled MMORPG Battleground Arena with up to 128 fellow gamers. Naturally, you can also get some for two or four player dueling arena time in! The expansive open world of SpellGear is called “Astarma”, which is inhabited by many diverse creatures and denizens. Once you select one of several magically-inclined classes you can choose from, you’re ready to jump into this amazing world and start exploring. Astarma two large, fully fleshed-out islands, of which travel between them is through powerful portals created from eldritch sorcery. These lands are quite striking to travelers when they first arrive, and you can almost feel a gentle breeze on your face as you take in the peaceful beauty of Astarma… But beware, Astarma is not nearly as safe and idyllic as it might initially seem! Since ancient times, these peaceful-looking lands have been torn asunder by a seemingly endless and bloody war between two rival Houses. Clashes can happen at any time and with great frequency as the entire world is open for PvP skirmishes. As a player, you won’t be able to stay on the sidelines—you’ll need to make a choice and pick a side. Until that point, though, new players can feel rather safe from members of the warring Houses. And for those who never want to pick a side, they’re welcome to take up the life of a freebooter—a mercenary—with all the consequences that come with that dangerous (but lucrative) decision. It’s important as a player to remember that choosing a House should happen after you’ve become acquainted with Astarma. Going through the main quest chain for the first level of battle ranking will greatly help you make the right decision for you. SpellGear takes place in a world riddled with crusades, and exploring these treacherous places will gain you valuable rewards. Any loot that you don’t deem necessary for you own needs can always be sold at auction. Indeed, crusades will provide you a lot of danger, sure, but you can rake in a tidy in-game income along with treasures, items, and weapons for yourself. When you have no more room in your bag to carry loots and other things, you will then be ready to move into your very own home. There you can store your hard-earned booty and relax. If you grow tired of playing the “regular” Spellgear, we’ve designed a PvP Hub where you can chat with your buddies, check in and dive into Arena brawls, or just go about your business with (almost) no fear of being killed. Astarma is a world full of people, and so with SpellGear we encourage all players to play with friends. The game gives you the ability to form small groups or entire clans, and these teams of players may be actual friends or new and old friends who have met in-game. Each clan is, of course, honorably distinguished by their own unique name, motto, and coat-of-arms. You’ll find that joining a clan can be very useful for you; because besides allowing you to team up with friends, you’ll also receive certain features and benefits. A virtual land of constantly bubbling and boiling action, SpellGear is a place chock full of in-game events that top leaders of the Houses regularly host. This is the part where we say “Well, what are you waiting for?”—Are you ready to choose your destiny? Features: Our unique and innovative combat system is non-target based, and you’ll have plenty or moves at your disposal, like dodges and special blocking maneuvers to counter damage; We offer some wicked modes: MOBA, MOBA-style, Classic, and Duel. Each one of these modes has their own particular rules and tactics. Pick your poison and have at it! You also get ability to use weapons and equipment of other classes. Choose a weapon and change skills in combat smoothly and with no worries; Astarma is a beautiful and open world, complete with dynamic day and night cycles. There are plenty of quests to undertake, interesting characters to encounter, enemies to conquer, places to explore, mysteries to solve, etc. Or you could simply enjoy a pleasant sunset with some good company; The main quest chain is specially designed to help you choose which House you’ll join (or if you’ll take the road less travelled and go Freebooter). In addition to all the quests you can take on, there will be various daily tasks to keep you busy, as well; Spellgear’s system of battle ranks is the equivalent of a level in classic RPG games. Increase your rank and become stronger, faster-- better; PvP Hub! A special box is provided with the ability to check into Arenas, chat with friends (which is also possible outside of the hub), and lead your clan without having to enter into the open world; Dungeons!

24381,红石遗迹 - Red Obsidian Remnant,2017-09-04,8.99,581,Red Obsidian Studio,"Beijing New Era Network Technology Co., Ltd.","Action,Adventure,Indie,RPG","Game System Introduction ★ A Roguelike gameplay and action system combined dungeon game. ★ Up to three weapons—used alternately in the battle, forming intricate attacks. ★ Props with many varying results to enrich your decisions in adventure as well as your outfits. ★ Monster differentiation system—the same monster may be affected by various differentiation elements, becoming tough to deal with. ★ With similar event mechanism like TPRG, all kinds events contain a certain choice and randomness. What are the creative motive, game plot and game mechanism of the Red Obsidian Remnant? Which games do you use for reference in the process of designing? As our first independent game, we choose the Roguelike dungeon type, because it is relatively well controlled. All the game experience is concentrated in a single hour of the game time, so that we can be more focused to make it rich and harmonious. Faced with the emerging of more and more roguelike dungeon games, what we can think of is to combine our game with ACT in order to make a difference. We hope the finally added plot can make the game more complete though the story is not the main part of the game. Speaking of reference, we’ve seen a lot of good works and I think that encourages us to make our own. So, you may feel intimacy while playing the game. Since we all have been more or less influenced by Falcom, I think our game style is somewhat similar to that. In the aspect of Roguelike elements, we borrow a lot from The Binding of Isaac. I am an old player of the retro arcade games. I played a lot of SNK’s classical fighting games and the Last Blade is my favorite. I like to play on the arcade fighting platform occasionally, to recall the past. What elements of the Red Obsidian Remnant do you think are interesting and innovative? In your opinion, what’s the core of the dungeon exploration roguelike game? It’s our first time to make a Roguelike game, but we played a lot and we learn from others. The Roguelike game is the concentration of the long-term RPG, in which players have to experience a time to develop, and to develop changing routines in order to maintain freshness in each play. The Red Obsidian Remnant is an action game and its fighting routine changes reflect more in moves. Besides, the equipment in the Red Obsidian Remnant is the key to influencing the development of the role. So we let the roles carry more weapons. The moves of each weapon can be used alternately and the combination of different weapons can directly form a fighting style. This can be counted as a solution, which just solved problems in the design. I think rules are born under various restrictions. What are the characteristics of the monster system in the game? How to keep the balance of the monster system and the difficulty of the game? As the action game, its basic part is to design monsters with different moves, based on which we add monster differentiation system. The differentiated monster will be attached around with spinning balls and each kind of the balls carries various effects, which may cause the monster explode or parasitize, split after death. You can simply do the math. Besides, there exist no monsters with pure armors since the armor will lead to the invalidity of the ACT basic system after the attack, and the failure to attack consistently, which will make you feel suck. Therefore, the characteristic of armors here is only adopted as part of the monster’s moves. As for the difficulty and the relationships among monsters, we will enhance the AI initiative of the monsters, times of differentiation and the probability of the emergence of dangerous houses in the high difficulty mode. The premise is to maintain the basic value of monsters. Sina Weibo",812,7299.88,554,2309,18,True,2017

Advanced tower types specialize in dealing with specific enemy types e.g. flame towers are great for destroying fast moving ground units, artillery towers are best at countering large groups of slow enemies, anti-air laser is ideal for shooting down heavy bombers. As the X-Morph fighter you can engage enemy units directly with a diverse arsenal of weapons. You can morph into four distinct forms which specialize in dealing with different kinds of threats. Each form has a basic attack and a special charged attack mode. The Plasma Fighter is the most universal form - good at destroying both air and ground units. The Dark Matter Bomber is great at decimating groups of ground units. It can also slow down time and release a dark matter bomb that can cut down buildings. The Shredder fighter is perfect for annihilating large numbers of human air units and clearing the sky. Finally, the Laser Destroyer is best for smelting large single units. It can also charge up a gravitational anomaly that sucks in smaller enemy units. A large variety of weapons and enemies along with a dynamic, fully destructible environment provides a rich arcade shooter experience. The game's environments are constructed with a lot of attention to detail and they are almost completely destructible. From small picket fences to huge skyscrapers. Any bridge or building in the game can be collapsed and it's destruction is dynamically simulated using realistic physics. The destruction is not only a visual effect as it can significantly influence the layout of the battlefield. The combination of dynamic environments, laser fences and real-time calculated enemy paths creates unique gameplay scenarios. Humans are desperate to defend their homeworld. They have created huge, building size, mechanical war machines to fight against each other, but now they will use them to destroy the X-Morph. Each boss fight is unique and heavily influences the gameplay environment. Entire cities will be destroyed. X-Morph: Defence includes a split screen co-op mode. All missions have different gameplay scenarios designed specifically for co-op play. Enemies attack in larger numbers and from new directions making good cooperation essential to winning. In this mode the game can be played in many different ways, one player can focus on optimizing tower placement while the other shoots at enemies or they can both focus their firepower on the strongest attackers. / /",2880,57571.2,2350,2314,44,True,2017
