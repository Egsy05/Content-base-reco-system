Before 1000, human beings and monsters fought for the war in the territory, although the two generals of the monster 'Star''Moon' were far more capable of fighting than humans, but somehow the war ended with human victory. After the war the monster settled in the monster forest and humans occupied most of the territory and the monster was isolated. As time goes on, the barriers between the monsters and humans gradually melt away, thus merging with each other and starting to live in harmony. Unfortunately, 20 years ago, there was a small conflict between a man's army in a routine patrol of the monster forest with cat monsters, but the cause was unclear, and the relationship between the man and the monster became terrible. As a soldier, I am 40 years old, but I did not participate in the conflict because of my leg injury. Today, when I was alone as a captain, I lost my way in the monster forest.

It's not so much about jumping and shooting as it is about you observing your own emotional connection to words and playing with those emotions, seeing if you use words to escape from a feeling. It’s a unique game of exploration and discovery through the human condition, using your emotional connection to words as a mechanic in itself. Inspired by the 20th century philosopher J. Krishnamurti, whose subject matter included psychological revolution, the nature of mind, meditation, inquiry and human relationships. Interact with the environment, paintings and other characters through a story that unfolds over 3 days and five locations: the home, the commute, the office, nature, and the self. The Word Is Not The Thing goes into separating the word from the feeling, allowing us to discover for ourselves what happens when we don't let the word interfere with the direct perception of the feeling. Not rejecting the word, or suppressing it, but seeing its effect. Not running away with explanations, or with another set of words. Seeing that escape. And doing nothing about it. Not just saying you get it, but actually doing it. Emotionality is the difficulty; the words get harder to deal with depending on your emotional connection to any given word. Choose to go inside yourself and go up against your core fear. FEATURES Experimental indie game, where emotions are the mechanic. Minimalistic black and white world to explore with emotions driven through words. Find, discover and remove words, seeing if you use words to escape from feelings.

Every game session is a story of a random monster hunter, a dwarf belonging to a special class of fighters trained to deal with rare and dangerous enemies. Going on a quest (that usually takes you from half to one and a half hours), the player will have to protect dwarf settlers living in a randomly generated village from an unknown enemy. History: The principal feature of a developing kingdom is its growing territory. The new lands are wild, and many dangers await brave colonists who dare to settle there. The new settlements need to be protected, but it would be too costly to send troops to the borders every time a problem arises. This is why the kingdom needs Monteros, monster hunters who do not possess superpowers or artifacts, but rely on constant training, intellect, and knowledge of their enemies. Gameplay: Every Montero starts the game already as a skilled tracker, craftsman, fighter, and hunter. The character does not level up any skills during a game session. The success of the mission depends on the player’s choice of the gear and their knowledge of the world that will grow from game to game. To defeat the final boss of the location, you will first have to find out who it is. In order to do that, your character will collect evidence (bits of fur and armor), talk to the locals, and even exhume bodies to examine the wounds. You will have to build barricades, set traps, make gear to prepare for the fight. This requires resources which you will find in the area or among the locals’ possessions. You will also have to help the settlers to recover from wounds, poisons, and illnesses. If there are no settlers left in the village, your mission is considered a failure. The final boss is not your only enemy. The newly settled territory is full of wild animals, robbers, poisonous mushrooms and insects. Monteros feel cold and hunger, suffer from poisoning, bleeding wounds, injuries and stress. The game will create a unique location for each session, so that every new mission is different from the previous ones. A successful mission adds objects to your collection of gear that will always be available for future missions. Succeeding, however, will not be easy, since you will have to adapt to the conditions, manage your resources wisely, learn to navigate the terrain, and be quick to employ your combat skills in a fight.

With Vigilantes, we wanted to offer you something fresh: a modern, neon drenched, rainy city in the midst of an unprecedented crime wave, supported by hard-boiled prose that brings the setting to life. It's no country for sorcerers or laser guns, but brace yourself for psychotic mob hitmen, molotov wielding doomsday cultists, and paramilitary survivalist snipers! 2: Intel Gathering You can't take down vast criminal organisations by getting into street fights with low level hoods. Surveillance operations can reveal basic information on the extent of a gang's presence in a city district, or how much wealth they are gaining from operations there. To put a gang out of commission, you must locate and eliminate their boss, and smash their facilities. To do this, you must fight your way up the gang hierarchy, using your skills and equipment, such as truth serum, to break them in interrogation. 3: Adversary System &amp; A Reactive Enemy When's the last time you saw an enemy attempt to flee in a turn based RPG? What happens if they escape, and come gunning for you down the line, more experienced and powerful than ever? When an enemy runs, will you give chase, or focus on active threats? The gangs will not sit back and allow you to dismantle their operations. They will carry out criminal operations, using the ill gotten proceeds on recruitment, equipment, training, and building buff providing rackets. Success comes with its own risks in Vigilantes. Once you get a gang's attention, they will dispatch deadly lieutenants to ambush and track you down. You may very well set out as the hunter and find yourself the hunted. Will I Like This Game? Should I Buy Vigilantes? The demo we released for Kickstarter is around 18 months old now, so it doesn't offer a good indication of the game's current features, content, polish, and balance. Thankfully, Steam offers a no quibble refund policy if you have spent less than 2 hours playing and have purchased less than 2 weeks ago, allowing you to see if you like Vigilantes, without committing to a purchase. While you won't be able to experience everything the game has to offer in 2 hours, it will give you a good idea of what to expect. Vigilantes is continually being improved, and we take feedback on board, so if you tend not to play Early Access games, please consider adding Vigilantes to your wishlist!",274,1641.26,171,1915,50,True,2018

Easy to pick up but hard to master, Penkura utilizes classic death mechanics that leave you without your equipment each time you perish. For this reason, you are able to construct your own robotic companions to help you build bases, gather resources, and protect your settlement. It encourages players to choose from a variety of approaches through which to complete their goals. Players will find themselves becoming an expert in areas entirely of their choosing. The intention is that, when the co-op is unveiled, players will find that the interaction of their unique skillsets with those of their peers creates capable and rewarding team gameplay. Penkura offers buildings, machines, bots, and items for you to construct. Most of it is made with the 'MMC' (Molecular Matter Converter) or through 'CCC' (Command Control Communication), which provides a top-down camera similar to that of classic RTS games. Should you desire, you can take control of your own intrepid bot to scout out a potentially hazardous environment or repair your base without stepping outside of the safety of your home. This is only the beginning of CCC potential; the rest is in your hands. Penkura’s crafting and base construction systems are made with co-op already in mind. Before its final release, you’ll be able to cooperate with other players to create huge, complex sets of items and stations that would normally take more than twice as long to put together. Deep beneath Antarctic ice, a Polish research team discovered an ancient temple that appeared to be a gateway to a fascinating new world.  The idea to migrate mankind to a new planet was a blessing for an overpopulated and devastated Earth. Project 'Gemini' was launched to colonize the new world. For 41 years, brave men and women traveled through the temple’s singularity. But one day, for reasons unknown, contact with the other side was severed. To learn what had happened in the world beyond, a group of mercenaries was tasked with traveling through the unstable gateway. You are one of those mercenaries.

A race against time and reason that will strain your sanity to its very limits -- and the survival of the whole world may depend on your decisions. Zanzibar, 1896. You are Dr. Jake Huntington, recently enlisted in the army trying to forget the loss of your dear wife Helen. An ancient evil is about to overturn your life forever. Every hint you find seems to lead you to the same conclusion: there is a terrifying disease that threatens to exterminate the entire human race -- and its origins may not be entirely natural. To understand what’s going on and try to stop it, you'll have to venture into the shadows that lurk in the confines of the human intellect, unraveling the intrigues, machinations, and subterfuges that try to veil the truth in darkness.

Many challenges, mysteries, friends, and enemies await you, Doctor. The time to face the unknown has come. CHOOSE YOUR OWN STORY Your choices will determine how the story unfolds. There are multiple ways to overcome the different obstacles that you will face, and every decision will have its consequences -- for you and for the fate of the entire human race.

The VR provides the experience, the chapter provides the social science context and background. The Fundamental Attribution Error, as coined by a Stanford Psychology Professor, describes how we blame others when bad things happen to them, but blame the external situations when bad things happen to us. There is a misconception that losing one's home is due to who you are and the choices you make. Becoming Homeless: A Human Experience seeks to counter this belief. In this immersive virtual reality experience from Stanford University’s Virtual Human Interaction Lab, spend days in the life of someone who can no longer afford a home. Interact with your environment to attempt to save your home and to protect yourself and your belongings as you walk in another’s shoes and face the adversity of living with diminishing resources. Researchers from Stanford have run thousands of participants through this experience in an effort to study the effect of VR experiences on empathy. Across our studies, we demonstrate that a VR experience changes helping behavior more than other types of perspective taking exercises, and the effect lasts months afterward. While this 7-minute journey does not come close to immense burden of living without a home, researchers continue to find that VR experiences can be a powerful tool to help put oneself in the shoes of another.

Build, harvest, and take resources from an environment where your every action affects the world around you. An imminent meteor strike threatens global destruction. Can you save the world without destroying it in the process? Construct buildings and towns, tend to your farm, hunt wildlife, build infrastructure and transportation, craft clothing, build power plants, and research new technologies. Specialize in a craft and trade your goods to other players. Develop your civilization and sculpt your planet. As your civilization grows, you’ll need to analyze data from the simulation; evaluating the impact you have on your world. Use this data as evidence in proposed laws, restricting harmful activities without disrupting the advancement of technology. Balance your individual needs with the needs of community, all while maintaining the state of the ecosystem. The future of your world is in your hands. Every organism in Eco exists as part of a detailed simulation; a disruption in one species can have cascading effects across the planet. Chop down all the trees, and habitats for creatures will be destroyed. Pollute the rivers with mining waste, and your farms will become poisoned and die. The ecosystem supplies the resources you and your community will need to stop the meteor. Manage your pollution, mining waste, hunting, and resource collection to balance your effect on this system. Eco is built on a rich ecological simulation. All the data generated from the interaction of plants, animals, climate, and players can be searched and analyzed using in-game graphs and heat-maps. Use the collected information as scientific evidence support to proposed laws. The ability to successfully debate using scientific evidence is your greatest weapon against the destruction of your world. Establish and maintain your own set of laws and government, which are enforced automatically by the game. Draft a proposal to limit clear-cutting in a protected forest, incentivize green energy solutions over fossil fuels by providing tax subsidies and penalties. Participate in elections for world leadership, allowing you to set tax rates and allocate community money. Use a programmable law system to make dynamic and flexible rules for the community, passing them by vote. Construct a wide variety of governments; from tightly-regulated dictator-states, to tax-and-spend subsidy programs, or even lawless communities relying on trust. Your skills increase based on your food and shelter. By consuming a highly nutritious variety of food and building an elaborate home you will rapidly increase your skill points. Skill points can be spent on skills like farming, hunting, trade, engineering, research, and more. Contribute to the greater good while increasing your own personal success. In the player-run economy, you achieve the most when you specialize and trade both goods and services. Create stores to buy and sell goods you need asynchronously with other players. Setup contracts within the game’s quest-like labor market, soliciting other players to perform specialized work for you in exchange for payment. Build complex crafting machines and charge a fee for players to use them. A thriving economy in Eco can be both a powerful tool for progress, or a dangerous threat to the environment. To grease the wheels of commerce, you can create your own currencies, backed by fiat or by resources. Manage the value of your currency relative to others by setting exchange rates at asynchronous currency exchanges. Sell items at stores and collect credit from other players. Eco is designed for rich asynchronous play, allowing many players of many disciplines to contribute to one another’s goals at separate or simultaneous times. All of the world’s resources originate from its environment, which is affected by your actions. While a meteor looms over head — set to strike the planet in thirty days — a more subtle threat grows from player-interaction with the environment. Without careful attention, ecological destruction can destroy civilization before the meteor even strikes. To ultimately succeed, you and your community will need to use the tools of government and economy to find a balance between progress and protection. Included Features Online Multiplayer - Collaborate online with a community of players. Local Singleplayer - Build your own world, with the option to invite friends. Dedicated Server Included - Host your own Eco worlds. Over 30 different craft tables, with hundreds of recipes. Hundreds of items, skills, craft tables, and building blocks. A simulated ecosystem with dozens of unique species. With limited carrying capacity, players must create vehicles and networks of roads to transport materials. Create your own backed or fiat currencies, using them as a means of exchange in the economy. Build stores where you can sell your excess items for a profit. Eat varied and nutritious food and build ever larger homes to increase your skills. Create contracts for jobs that you would like players with different skill-specialties to accomplish for you. Take on contracts from other players that need the skills you possess. Design laws using programmable template system to protect your world or increase your profits, enforced by the game if ratified by the population. Run for election and make decisions that affect the globe. View and compile rich data from the simulation and use it to argue for group decisions. Claim land as your own property, and share access rights. Give and remove reputation from other players. Find a balance between progress and protection, between individual needs and those of the group, succeeding or failing together. Eco is our forever project. We plan to keep growing, expanding, and improving it with the support of the community. Follow our plans and progress through the Eco Tree, which displays in-depth details on current and future features.

You control the Gambol Gumball through a gauntlet of levels designed with flow and rhythm in mind to test your platforming grit. But don't be too nervous, because along with the slick controls you also have a triple jump that's energy is reset upon touching any (non-lethal) surface, including the ceiling. Holy cow, that sounds great. The controls are simple enough that you could play it on a NES controller, with only run, jump, left, right, down-boost, and [REDACTED] to worry about. What's that “[REDACTED]” all about? Hah, don't think too much about it, it's probably nothing. “Whoa!” you say, “this looks crazy hard, is this one of those games that Poo-Dee-Pah yells at on the YouVideo?” Nah, it's not too bad, the levels appear a bit tougher than they really are since I had to put in more obstacles to make up for all that sweet, juicy, player agency you have. Oh, and when you inevitably meet your demise at the hands of a spike, laser, bomb, floating-shock-ball-of-hurt, or whatever else, you re-spawn within a couple seconds (or just hit the level-restart button if you're fidgety like me), so it's no biggie if you have to re-run a level a few times before you get the hang of it.

You will be able to see how our format seamlessly merges with a real 3D environment. Cappasity and the New York Academy of Art have partnered to research the ways of fast and qualitative production of virtual museums, galleries, and exhibitions. The gained experience will help convert online visitors into physical ones and bring the exhibit to those who for some reason are unable to attend. This is not a photogrammetry solution. Not a game. This is a demonstration of Cappasity 3D format and Cappasity plug-in for Unity. Just a few minutes to create one 3D image! Creating a 3D image of any piece is a simple 3-step process: shoot the chosen object with a digital camera, upload the result into Cappasity platform to get a 3D View and once it’s ready, embed it into anything you wish, be it website, mobile or 3D/AR/VR application. Besides the simplicity of use Cappasity software is also very fast, in fact, it is ten times faster in 3D production than any known 3D technology and doesn’t require any specific equipment. “I can see this in the future being a platform that every art school is going to want to use. We really think that this is a gamechanger not only for educational environments but also for working artist and galleries,” comments Peter Drake, Provost of the New York Academy of Art. A question that artists may feel the need to ask is whether all types of materials can be visualized in 3D. The answer is a resounding yes. Sculptors working in papier mache, in stone or cast metals will experience no difficulties with digitalization thanks to the Cappasity 3D imaging technology. “Cappasity (software) is a great tool for 3D artists. It allows them to give you a real sense for the work spatially … to show it in a dynamic way that looks much more professional and innovative,” — says Holly Frisbee, Director of Library and Special Collections of the New York Academy of Art.",7,0.0,1,1844,0,True,2018

This valley is one of the parallel worlds where the bones of those who are gone are dumped. There rests a divine diamond capable of giving life to the skulls, so that they are living longer and learning what is missing, in the end, become worthy to go to heaven.

The name for this is a 'Kinetic Novel' -- a subgenre of Visual Novels. You still click through at your own pace, of course, like any other VN, as well as save, load, and view a backlog of what you've recently read. This is a linear story about a teenage boy named Keitaro Soseki from Kagoshima, Japan. It is a Slice-of-Life romance novel with lots of comedy as well. For those familiar with VN genres, most of the story is considered 'Iyashikei', but there is a tragic element as well. There are 20 characters with voice acting and expressions. Character list: Keitaro - Main character. Smart, innocent, a little shy. Yuri - Keitaro's younger sister. Bubbly and bright. Haruko - Keitaro's older brother. Sporty and mature...for the most part. Noriyuki - One of Keitaro's best friends. He is obsessed with girls and plays competitive video games for the high school eSports team. Shino - A mature and reserved study-bug with a thing for Yuri. Ayuna - Yuri's best friend. Has an interest in Noriyuki. Kadan, Joji, and Orino - Haruko's friends who play for the school's American football team. Kadan is a giant goofball, literally and figuratively. Joji is his loyal sidekick who constantly fails to prevent him from making a fool of himself. Orino is the wisest of the bunch, often scolding Kadan for his clunky behavior and trying to prevent himself from looking like an idiot in their presence. Mai and Tomomi - Keitaro's parents. They're a warm, simple couple. The characters all swap out for a new set in the second part of the story, except for Keitaro who stays present throughout. Rinji - Another goofball, extremely animated (without any literal animation, of course). He frequently tries to impress Kasumi. Takeo - Just as obsessed with girls as Noriyuki, but is a little smoother about it. Hana - Keitaro's cousin. She has a passion for spirituality and her head can be in the clouds at times. Aiko - Keitaro's cousin. He is a video game developer and sometimes reminds Keitaro of Noriyuki. He is also a passionate futurist who has complete opposite beliefs from his sister. They bicker easily. Kasumi - Bubbly and kind. She is always smiling or laughing. Despite her excessive cuteness, she is smarter than she looks. Keiko - Keitaro's love interest. Wholesome and sweet. She has significant similarities to Keitaro but also complementary differences that make for a natural progression from friend to lover. She is as confident as he is shy. Tamiko and Michio - Keitaro's aunt and uncle. Tamiko is responsible and protective and Michio is a fun and hearty goof. There are a series of adventures in the first part of the novel with Keitaro and his friends/siblings. The second part of the novel progresses into a more developed and committed storyline with much more depth to it.",6,11.94,2,2029,0,True,2018

You can defend by strategically building fortification towers to defend the harvesting platforms against aliens called Kraken. As commander it's upto you how you use your resources against the Kraken. Check it out before buying Before purchasing the game we recommend checking out the following gameplay video to get a good idea about the game. Game Overview The game is staged on a beautifully rendered planet with dynamic procedurally generated scenery. Many elements of the game including the enemy waves are generated procedurally offering a unique experience each game. Rather than a single master solution to each game level there are a whole multitude of possibilities. Instead of a linear 20 mission campaign, each mission is in part designed by the players choice of planet region, sector, and game level layout. Additionally a tech research tree provides an opportunity for the player to develop even more strategies as they progress through the game. Defense Task Force features 25 different types of enemy units versus 10 types of towers deployed by the player. Each tower features completely different attack behaviors, 3 upgrade levels and individual attribute boosts. The player needs to invest their rewards from winning each game level into researching a deep technology tree to unlock these before they may be used in game. The choice of which technology to research has a direct impact on the strategy options available to the player. Great care is being taken with respect to game balancing such that there is no single super tower. The attack behavior of the ten tower types are both different and complementary to each other. Once each mission is won you may proceed to the next mission or continue and try survive as many waves as you can. Game Features Large Scale Procedurally Generated Tower Defense Battles with FPS Quality Visuals. The main storyline features a campaign of 20 missions which would provide at minimum 15 hours of gameplay. The campaign structure is significant non linear aspects which make each level replayable in multiple different ways. The enemy waves are procedural generated with randomness for infinite mode gameplay of never ending waves. Additionally when playing the same mission a second time the wave composition will be different. The waves are composed of a total of 25 different types of alien enemy units plus 3 additional units which are spawned by other units. Each type of unit has differences based on speed, hit points, shield, strengths/weaknesses against tower types and special abilities providing for a large multitude of strategies to beat the players towers. The game features dynamic environments based on: procedurally generated background terrain and weather. Additionally the game level itself is based on a combination of environment and player selected game level layout (blueprint). These combinations provide very high replayability and variability of the same mission. The campaign is divided into 5 regions each containing 4 sectors to create a total of 20 missions. However the game level layout of each mission is dependent on the blueprint (energy mining platform) which the player researches and deploys for the mission. Ten types of towers are provided each with 3 upgrade levels. Additionally the third level tower can have its individual attributes such as rotation speed, damage, etc... upgraded individually. All of these upgrades must first be researched in a deep skills tree before they can be used in the game. Each tower type has a unique attack profile allowing the player to build a very wide variety of tower combinations. No tower is superior to others and to win the player must use a range of towers. Skills, unlock and research tree. The player uses energy gained from winning missions for both unlocking and researching. For the missions each region and sector must be unlocked before they can be played. Each blueprint (game level layout) must be researched before it can be deployed. Each skill such as global skills as well as tower upgrades must be researched before they are available in game.

Telemetry is a key factor in eSports racing, allowing sim drivers to interpret data collected during a race or session and use them to properly tune their driving style and vehicle setup for optimum performance. SRT is the right tool to improve the in-game performance of any sim racer, as real telemetry tools do for real drivers. It’s an indispensable tool to study and plan the setups for time-attacks, qualifications and races. Sim Racing Telemetry records all available telemetry data during timed laps and presents them on simple and intuitive interfaces: drivers can analyze data by looking at bare numbers, interactive charts or projected on a reconstructed track. Recorded sessions are also summarized with charts. Available telemetry data vary based on the used game (see the specific DLC for the complete list). SUPPORTED GAMES F1 22 (PC, PS4/5, Xbox); Assetto Corsa (PC); Project Cars 2 (PC, PS4/5, Xbox); F1 2021 (PC, PS4/5, Xbox); F1 2020 (PC, PS4/5, Xbox); F1 2019 (PC, PS4/5, Xbox); F1 2018 (PC, PS4/5, Xbox); MotoGP 18 (PC, PS4/5, Xbox - official support, in collaboration with Milestone); F1 2017 (PC, PS4/5, Xbox, macOS); Project Cars (PC, PS4/5, Xbox); F1 2016 (PC, PS4/5, Xbox, macOS).

More about the game You win by either scoring the most Victory Points (VPs) or being the first to reach a certain preset VP threshold, depending on scenario and custom choices in the main menu. To do so, you must capture regions over the world, and defeat your enemies in battle. The world has about 130 regions open to conquest. The regions have variable income and VP values (set randomly in the Standard scenario) and unknown until conquered or spied upon. Each region not owned by a Major Power usually has an independent Minor country owning and defending it. Each Major country is controlled by a human player or the computer, or is designated neutral and then acts as a Minor country. Hotseat play is possible, with an option to limit to 4.00 minutes the playing time per player. Each game turn represents roughly one of the 4 seasons. Winter is a special one, with limited movements, severe weather conditions and restricted actions. Game lasts till scenario victory conditions are achieved or when the three Viking powers have converted to Christianity. Starting with the year 700 AD, it will last till shortly after 1100 AD or earlier (if the player is eliminated or becomes Christian). Scenarios: game offers 3 scenarios, each starting at a decisive turn point in history: 700 AD (start of Viking Age), 850 AD (the apex of Viking expansion) and 1000 AD (the last major conquests of the Vikings and Northmen) Each turn has main phases, e.g. - Build Phase (not in winter for most) with: Warrior &amp; Ships Construction, Fortification, Raids, Discoveries, Trade, Espionage, Sale of Mercenaries (Winter only), - Movement Phase (land &amp; sea), - and Combat Phase. Gameplay of each phase is rather simple and straightforward, as follows: - Army and Navy Constructions (Not in winter): Create new warriors and ships in your castles (and only there) - Fortification: Fortify army units (except in Castles which are already fortified). - Sale of Mercenaries (winter only): sell your idle warriors to neighbors and earn gold for them. After a year of service, the survivors come home and are available again. When on service abroad, they add to the defense of regions they are sent to. - Espionage (Not in winter): Learn the approximate (not always accurate) army strength and the income of a Minor country or of a region controlled by a Major country. And the region’s VP value - Trade (Not in winter): Spend money to establish trading posts in foreign lands and receive continuous extra income from trade (till your trade post is destroyed or you conquer the region they are in). - Raid (Not in winter): Send ships (no need of warriors, the crews will do well) to raid enemy regions. You may earn great amounts of gold by plundering them, but beware of exhaustion (the more a region is looted, the less it brings rewards) and counter-attacks - Movement Phase (All turns): Move warriors to adjacent regions only. Move ships alone or with warriors from one port to another up to three regions at a time (or carry warriors to amphibious landings on enemy holdings). You can move up to 6 different groups (plus one extra for each castle you own). - Combat Phase (All turns): up to 6 rounds of battle; each consists of naval (if ships are present) then land battles. Combat is simultaneous and the Vikings get a slight advantage when attacking from the sea. - Fight the expansion of the Franks, Byzantines and Arabs, and their nasty counter-attacks if you seize some of their regions. - and remember to care about the weather, from deadly tempests to freezing winters!",39,194.61,10,1929,33,True,2018

We will try to roll out updates as quickly as possible. Join our DISCORD community to help report bugs and request features. BACKSTORY In the world of Dissolution, the Earth has been destroyed by weapons of mass destruction in a desperate attempt to halt the AI advance that had taken over most of the planet. While most humans were unable to escape the planet before the missiles fell, small pockets of humanity had spread to most of the solar system and a handful of survivors kept trying to hold humanity together. The game takes place almost three centuries after the final war on Earth. The AI production facilities were all destroyed in the nuclear fire, but some of their troops survived and are holed up on the dark edges of the solar system. However, survival isn't easy. Food is always in short supply, and filtering and harvesting water takes precious energy. What was left of the military forces united to form the Inter-Planetary Defense Force (IPDF). Their mission is mainly to serve as peacekeepers resolve disputes, and protect settlers from bandits who would steal supplies by force. What makes people human is quickly fading in the face of famines, murder, and constant threat from the remaining AI forces. GAMEPLAY Dissolution has both FPS and space vehicle in gameplay. The gameplay that we’re aiming for is immersive and intense, in both the in-game economy and combat. Dissolution is a living game, which means every action you take in the game will have real consequences. Something as simple as mining and selling ore will have a butterfly effect in the world: ore prices will decrease, factories would get cheaper to run, and eventually even the price of goods drop. Meanwhile, if you attack a trading route as a pirate cutting off the supply route of the same ore, it would have the opposite effect. We will allow players a great deal of freedom and personal choice in how they play the game. You'll be able to purchase properties, vehicles, weapons, trade stocks and bonds, and get involved in a free-floating economy where prices are decided by supply and demand. You could be a pacifist and not even own a firearm, or become a ruthless pirate pillaging supply ships and leaving no survivors. A marketplace will allow free trading to take place between players. DEVELOPMENT Our team is composed of four very dedicated game developers who want to create a different take on space MMO games. We are currently about a year and a half into development, and are planning for the game to hit 1.0 release before 2022. Our Trello page can be found HERE for people that want a more in-depth look at our milestones. Currently the early access alpha is available for the general public to help us test and receive feedback on gameplay design.",185,0.0,27,1844,0,True,2018

If that is a deal-breaker for you then I cannot suggest you buy the game. Otherwise, Zero G Arena does feature bots, private servers and has an official discord which players can use to arrange matches. See below for a full list of features. Zero G Arena is an arena shooter with zero gravity, ragdoll physics, grappling beams and magnet boots . It's an intense combination! The game is designed to work on multiple levels of play: The novelty of the mechanics and the sheer fun of floating and swinging about the levels provides a fun experience at any level of play. The outlandish hijinks that are enabled by the ragdoll physics, grapple beams and fast-paced action make the game hilarious fun to play casually with friends (or with friendly strangers on public servers...). At it's core, Zero G Arena is a balanced, competitive game with an extremely high skill-ceiling. Mastery of the movement mechanics is of more importance than aiming ability. You may also be surprised by it's tactical depth (feel free to ask me on the forums for more about this). Gameplay Movement You can toggle your boot magnets freely to switch between running on magnetic surfaces or floating with zero gravity ragdoll physics. You also have a grappling beam, which can be used to pull yourself around and swing about while floating. As well as these technological locomotive methods, you also have a powerful set of core movement abilities: A set of basic jumps, which can be controlled intuitively using the spacebar and movement keys. A wall-jump, which can be used while floating to bounce from wall to wall. A crouch ability, which can be used to do a crouching slide on magnetic surfaces to dodge enemy fire. Combat Zero G Arena features a set of 5 futuristic firearms. All players start with the same default weapon and can acquire other weapons from pickups in the map. Zero G Arena also features a pickup that can turn your grapple-beam into a weapon that damages other players on intersection. Use your speed as a weapon with the melee kick! It's damage scales greatly with your speed relative to the target. Game Modes Zero G Arena features the classic Free-For-All, Team-Deathmatch and King-Of-The-Hill game modes, as well as these Zero-G originals: ”Capture-The-Sphere”: Like the familiar Capture-The-Flag game mode, except the “flag” is a large, floating sphere. Players must use their grapple beams to pull the sphere to their goal, while fighting off the other team. ”Spaceball”: A fast, team-based sporty game-mode similar to Soccer/Football. Players don't have any weapons other than a non-lethal “Force Cannon”, which can be used to shoot the ball across the map. Features Online multiplayer, with either dedicated or listen (player hosted) servers. Find other players on one of the dedicated servers, or host a private game for you and your friends. Bots which are available for offline play, or on servers while you wait for other players. No in-game monetary transactions. A number of cosmetic options for your avatar, which are unlocked through Steam achievements. Basic support for LAN matches.

Escape the clutches of an Evil Wizard and discover the secrets hidden within the spellbound castle of your ancestors. We take the role of princess Tsioque, imprisoned in a castle overtaken by the Evil Wizard. When darkness falls on your ancestral home, places formerly familiar suddenly turn unfriendly and dangerous. The castle walls have become a deadly trap - we must escape and thwart the Evil Wizard's plans before the spell he has cast on the castle escalates, triggering events beyond anyone's control... A 100% hand-drawn, frame-by-frame animated 2d adventure game with a unique atmosphere. Humor? Check. Darkness? Check. Suspense? Check! What more could you ask for? Story with a twist - a clever story that may surprise you. Beautiful, hand-drawn backgrounds. Beautiful, hand-drawn backgrounds. Fully voiced dialogue tracks. Exceptional soundtrack by Edward Harrison (NEOTOKYO, LUCKY DAY FOREVER) and Elle Kharitou, dynamically illustrating the gameplay and adjusted to your every action. The protagonist - a little girl with a talent for bringing chaos and destruction wherever she goes. Those who dare stand in her way are in for a lot of trouble... A changing, mysterious and dangerous world - even before the Wizard's attack, the castle held many secrets. Now, bound by a powerful spell, the castle not only became home to demons and magical creatures, but has also been affected itself by the evil power... It bends and shapeshifts, forming layers upon layers of transformation and illusion... It is an essential part of the plot, and - especially later in the game - an element tightly integrated into the gameplay. You can 'die' in this game! - It's an adventure game, so explore, solve puzzles... but beware. There won't always have the comfort of infinite time to solve a problem, sometimes you may have to think fast! Other times you may want to think twice before choosing a new course of action, as a wrong decision may cost you your freedom... or worse! The world of TSIOQUE is inhabited by creatures of all sorts - humans, animals, monsters, you name it. Don't let appearances deceive you, some seemingly nice people may not necessarily have the best intentions, and a seemingly terrifying monster may not be all that evil. Fortunately, even when events turn for the worst, Tsioque can always count on help from her friends, which she will find in least expected places. The main inspiration is inarguably LIFE, which always writes the best scritps. But of course we're not living in cultural vaccuum. While creating TSIOQUE, we couldn't help but be inspired by things that thrilled, shocked and amazed us in the past, that burned forever into our memory in the childhood days spent in front of the pale light of CRT monitors. Among many other inspirations, we could certainly count: a smart, humorous story backed by beautiful art style of DAY OF THE TENTACLE, simplicity of the gameplay and a serious approach to a younger player in games by Ron Gilbert like PAJAMA SAM, a vivid, dangerous world seen through the eyes of a boy in HEART OF DARKNESS, wonderfully animated epic fantasy and its gruesome punishments for failures in DRAGON'S LAIR, or INDIANA JONES AND THE FATE OF ATLANTIS, an old Lucasarts classic with a perfect blend of adventure, humor and action, where carelessness could cost you dearly.",1438,20117.62,1312,1880,33,True,2018

Take your creatures into randomly generated dungeons called 'Realms'. There, you'll fight against enemies that can be killed to increase your creatures' experience points, as well as drop resources and items that you can use to further improve your party. There are 15 different tilesets for Realms, and each Realm offers exclusive creatures, quests, events, and much more. Your creatures can equip items called Spell Gems, which allow them to cast the spells contained in these gems. You can enchant these Spell Gems to add new properties to them which change the way the spell works. For example, you can customize the type of damage the spell does, or cause the spell to activate an additional effect after a creature casts it. There are over 300 Spell Gems to find in the game, and over 20 properties that you can add to each spell. The possibilities are endless! Each of your creatures can also equip an Artifact. Artifacts are items that grant the equipped creature a wide array of bonuses. These bonuses range anywhere from a simple boost to their attacks, all the way to granting them new traits and spells. Artifacts have randomly generated properties, but you can also utilize over 1000 different crafting materials to add, remove, or modify these properties. Different creatures work better with different properties, so you'll need to experiment to figure out what works best for your team! There's an insane amount of rare items and accomplishments to collect. Here's a brief list... and believe it or not, this doesn't even begin to scratch the surface. Cards - these rare items have a small chance to drop from enemies after you defeat them. They grant bonuses to you and your creatures just by having them in your inventory. It will take a long time to find all of the 700+ cards in the game! Talismans - these work a lot like Cards in that they provide you with passive bonuses. However, by completing certain end-game content, you can upgrade your Talismans to improve the bonus and even unlock new powers! Favor - There are 15 gods in the game, and you can increase your favor with each one. As you do so, you'll unlock new game features, creatures, items, and more! Knowledge - the more you defeat a certain creature, the more knowledgeable you'll become about it, which unlocks new bonuses when you're fighting against that creature. Eventually, you'll be able to see a creature's health/mana bars in battle, view their lore in the library, deal additional damage to them, gain more experience points and resources by defeating them, and increase their chance to drop their Card. Singular Creatures - each creature in the game has a 'Singular' counterpart. Singular Creatures are extremely difficult to find and have a unique color palette. Achievements - the game has hundreds of achievements for you to collect. When you earn an achievement, you'll gain some Achievement Points which improve the quality and quantity of loot you'll find during your travels. Wardrobe and Titles - you can unlock new costumes for your character to wear (such as a chef's uniform), as well as titles that change your name (so you might go from being called 'King James' to 'James the Drunk'). Wardrobes and titles can be seen by other players when you participate in asynchronous player-versus-player battles. Don't you hate when a good game comes to an end? We do too. That's why Siralim 3 never truly ends. There's not even a level cap. You can continue leveling your character and creatures forever, all while still finding new challenges waiting for you just around the corner. We've crafted every game mechanic around players who want to someday accumulate hundreds, if not thousands of hours of playtime. Completing the game's main story quests is just the beginning. After that, you'll unlock countless new systems to keep you entertained for hundreds of hours to come. Here's a brief list of some of the game's end-game content, but again, there's so much more to this game than we can possibly write here. Itherian Realms - these work like normal Realms (as we described earlier), except these have randomly generated properties that change the way the enemies or even the Realm itself behaves. You can acquire and upgrade Talismans in Itherian Realms in order to bolster your party. You can even find the elusive Itherian Creatures here, which are rare creatures that have unique traits you won't find anywhere else. Tavern Brawls - fight against other players' creatures in asynchronous player-versus-player combat. You can earn exclusive Spell Gems, creatures, and other items if you win! End-Game Quests - a never-ending supply of quests and missions for you to complete long after you experience the main storyline quests. Super Bosses - we can't spoil what these are or how they work here, but rest assured that you'll face plenty of grueling challenges by fighting these bosses... and you'll be handsomely rewarded if you manage to win. Arena - draft a team of creatures and see how many enemies you can take down before your party is wiped out. More is on the way! We're committed to bringing content updates that include tons of awesome, end-game content after the game launches. Q: Do I need to play Siralim or Siralim 2 before playing Siralim 3? Are the stories related in any way? A: Siralim 3 is a completely standalone game, and for that reason, you should have no problems playing it without playing the other games first. While the stories in Siralim 2 and 3 are intertwined, they can still be enjoyed independently. In short, there's something for new and old players alike! Q: What's new from Siralim 2? A: We already listed most of the new features elsewhere on this page, but if you're looking for a more concise list, check out the FAQ on our website ! Q: What platforms is Siralim 3 available on? A: It is currently available on Steam(PC/Mac/Linux), Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Android (Google Play), and iOS. Q: What games did you draw inspiration from to create Siralim 3? A. We drew inspiration from multiple different genres. Monster catching games: Dragon Warrior Monsters, Pokemon, and Monster Rancher. ARPGs: Grim Dawn, Path of Exile, and Diablo 3. We also drew some inspiration from roguelike games. Siralim blends these genres together to create a unique experience with unlimited depth of gameplay.",950,14240.5,842,1903,1173,True,2018

Gameplay There are 13 basic enemy types, one is added every level you go up. Even though it's single player, the combat often resembles an MMO more than any single-player genre, although it isn't grindy like an MMO. The way you pull and aggro enemies and use crowd control to avoid damage should feel familiar, but RainbowCult ratchets up the pace much higher. You can throw three basic spells, but these also can be combined in six different ways to make important utility spells that add a lot of variety to the gameplay. Bosses The boss fights could be described as a puzzle, much in the same way that MMO boss fights are a puzzle - you have a limited set of mechanics and you have to figure out how to apply them to the encounter. These 13 bosses each have 3 difficulty levels, which add new mechanics to the boss to make the fight more dynamic and challenging, training you for the final NG++ encounter. There aren't quick-time-events or glowing weak spots. Just you, a handful of spells, and your wits. Can't figure out one of the boss fights? Skip it and come back later when you realize what you were doing wrong! Multiple endings Each of the three difficulties has a unique cutscene at the end, rewarding you for beating all 13 of the bosses. Game length Based on our testing we estimate it should take at least 8 hours to beat all 39 encounters and see all of the endings, but a typical player will probably spend 12-16 hours, since you won't know the enemies or the boss fight mechanics on your first playthrough. Highlights recap Battle your way through 13 floors of the Ogle offices, fighting a variety of enemies Each floor has a boss and an optional hero to help make the boss encounter easier Fight the 13 bosses in any order, but beware, higher floors have harder basic enemies Every boss has two additional hard modes to unlock, each giving the boss extra abilities Three unique endings, one for each difficulty",1,19.99,1,1893,78,True,2018

Dark, disturbing, unsettling - Beckett is a powerful narrative adventure game that gets under your skin and makes you question everything about yourself and the very nature of reality. The game is a single-player, point-and-click style experience that lasts around 3 hours. But it will be in your head for a long time after. WHY WE MADE IT We made Beckett as a story that could stand shoulder-to-shoulder with the best of literature, theatre and independent world cinema. It won the Games category in the 2018 BAFTA Scotland awards, made various game-of-the-year lists (2018) and was made part of V&amp;A Dundee's permanent gallery collection. You could call it a psychological horror. You could call it an anti-love story. You could call it a surrealist nightmare. Beckett is a disturbing, unique experience that will make you question what it is to exist. The game puts reality under the spotlight, drawing you into a missing person's case set in a dark and unforgiving world. Our main character, Beckett, morns the loss of his wife - she was everything to him, but time has passed and life has lost meaning. Then there's the City, which plays with Beckett like cat with a baby bird, making him act against his will. You must take control, explore, navigate, interact, talk, defy... we're all memories waiting to happen, we're all memories waiting to fade. PRAISE FOR BECKETT 'A rare example of total and genuine auteurism in the games world' - Glixel, Rolling Stone 'convincingly uncompromised' - Alphr 'Beckett impresses at every turn.' - Cubed3 'An innovative and engrossing experience.' - Russell Lees, creator of The Dark Eye 'A powerful experience for those willing to dive into it.' - Big Boss Battle.

That was until they stepped into the Host's office. Standing on top of his enourmous desk, The Host smiled as he held up a small remote device. His finger danced over the bright blinking red button. He taunted the angry rebels, trying to convince them he held their lives in his hands. All the contestants looked to Zork for their next move. He knew they were tired and worn out; it was time to make a deal. Aiming high, he tried to gain everyone's release. By the end of negotiations he had garaunteed their freedom but only after the new season ended. It wasn't perfect, but it was something and the contestants knew if The Host didn't hold up his end of the deal they could just fight their way out. They all started heading back to their chambers when The Host suddenly slipped trying to get off his desk. Everything happened in slow motion; he fumbled with the device, tossing and turning, falling through the air. It all ended abruptly with the sound of a button clicking. That's when the rhythmic beeping began. He looked over at his contestants, each one now had a green blinking light in their chest. Seconds later they all exploded into bits and parts. At first, The Host was frantic trying to put all the pieces back together. It was impossible, nothing matched anymore and he just sat in silence thinking about all the money he lost. It took sometime for him to realize the potential of this ... opportunity, but once he did It didn't take long for The Host to pull the plug, or in this case push the button, on the rest of his staff. Now he could make his contestants look any way he wanted and the best part was the exploding microchip had fried everyone's hypothalamus, making them addicted to combat and competitions.

Two teams of 5 players fight to capture and control the Relic, an ancient and powerful magical artifact key in the eternal struggle between Light and Darkness. In Blood Ancestors, you create your own hero choosing between 3 factions , 6 characters archetypes , and 18 different classes – and on top of that, you pick 3 skills ( Aggressive, Defensive, Utility ) to create a unique build that fits your playstyle like a glove. With weapon or magic, feed the earth with the blood of your enemies to unleash your powerful ultimate attack, secure the Relic, and decide the fate of the war! CONTROL THE RELIC TO WIN THE MATCH, BECOME THE PAYLOAD! To win a match of Blood Ancestors, you need to take the Relic to your enemies’ spawning portal. For that, it needs to be unlocked first by feeding it with your own lifeforce: it will drink the blood of whoever stands nearby. Once it’s full, whoever snatches it first becomes the Bearer; killing him/her grants control over the Relic. Besides, there are two magical pillars on the map, one of Health, another of Speed. If the Bearer’s team control a pillar, it will increase his/her Health or Speed; if it’s controlled by the enemy team, it will decrease them instead. SETTING Hundreds of years ago, a race of slaves found a way to escape their cruel masters, the Blood Ancestors. They discovered a portal between dimensions that led them from Arham, their homeworld, to the new planet of Vetlan. Feeding the portal with the power of the ancient Relic, a powerful magical artifact created eons ago by the Ancestors, these slaves crossed the portal, and closed it behind them; and calling themselves the Blood Ones, they established in this new home, and lived in peace for generations. But war broke soon in this new planet between two factions, the Light Ones, and the Dark Ones; and the Blood Ones were silent witnesses of a war which ended countless lives, and that threatened to destroy the world of Vetlan itself. One day, they decided that, after having escaped slavery and death, they could not stand idle while the planet was being torn apart by the eternal struggle between Light and Darkness. The Blood Ones opened the portal again and traveled back to Arham to face the Ancestors, claim the Relic and use its power to end the war and pacify both worlds. But Light and Darkness learned of their plans, and followed them to Arham – and war followed them too. Now, the three factions fight for the Relic – and the Blood Ancestors remain silent and hidden, letting everyone fight over it for reasons known only to them. Who knows what are they plotting in their twisted minds, evermore obsessed with power and domination? FACTIONS The Dark Ones are the first native inhabitants of Vetlan. Beings without a physical body, mere shadows full of dark energy, they live in deep caves and crevices honoring Arteis, a feared god of the night and shadow. They wager an endless war against the Light Ones. The Light Ones awakened one day in the dark surface of Vetlan, flourished quickly and spread across the whole world. When they were about to lose the war against the Dark Ones a powerful light exploded in the sky, helping them to drive their enemies back. Since then they adore that light as their goddess and name themselves Humans, the Light Ones. The Blood Ones were once the slaves of the Ancestors. They fled to Vetlan, where they found themselves in the middle of a war between the two native races. After a series of cataclysms, they discovered that the magic used in the war had destabilized the core of the planet, and decided to go back to use the power of the Relic to save Vetlan and stop the war.

You wake up in an internal representation of your conscience where your goal is to collect 100 memory fragments throughout increasingly complicated and increasing in size levels, or dreams. But there is a catch! These levels are not illuminated. You have a Photon gun that you can use to light your way up as you go through these levels. Initially this is only in form of colorful balls, or photons, that your shoot from your gun, and they light up a certain area. As you collect fragments, the upgrades will become available for you, such as a flashlight attachment, a scan grenade - that shows an outline of the world around you and highlights points of interest, and others. Once you collect 100 fragments the final room will open where you can go to end the game. To provide maximum replayability, level generation is based of a Pseudo Random Number Generator. The seed you choose or randomly generate when starting a new game will dictate how your levels look, what they are made of, how many fragments you will find in each level and etc. This means that you can complete the game on various difficulties for the same seed, or various seeds for the same difficulty and every time it will look different. PD features 4 difficulties: Easy, Medium, Hard and Impossible. Based on your chosen difficulty your gameplay may be quite relaxing as you quickly go through levels or very challenging. The tiles that make up your level have a difficulty rating from 1 to 10. On easy, the difficulty rating increases every 10 levels, on impossible - every 2 level. As the difficulty keeps increasing you will find that the levels will be made up with tiles that are increasingly trickier. We have to admit higher level tiles give even the calmest of us an urge to smash something. Levels also gradually increase in size - more so with chosen difficulty. There is also an assortment of various barricades, traps and pickups that will also spawn for you.

Baseball Mogul® begins in any year you choose, from 1900 to present day with the full roster of your favorite team -- or an entirely fictional team of your own creation. As General Manager (GM), your job is to build the best lineup of players to take your team to the World Series. You can make complex player trades and sign players to multi-year contracts as you build your team, but you'll have to compete with the other General Managers, and negotiate with the player's agents. As GM you also have to manage all the finances for your ball club, making sure that the team doesn't go bankrupt. Raise revenue for your team by setting the price of tickets and concessions, and selling the TV broadcast rights, while you manage your team's expenses by setting the budget for your farm system, player scouts, medical staff, and player payroll. But be careful, because fans can be fickle if your team doesn't win or if your tickets become too expensive! If you don’t succeed in your first year, you get a new chance with Baseball Mogul’s in-depth amateur draft. You pick and choose from the best high school and college talent around the world. If your new players are good enough, have them join your team right away, otherwise send them to your minor league franchise for training and improvement. Your involvement as GM does not stop in the team's front office. Baseball Mogul gives you complete control over your team on the field. You start by setting the starting defense, batting order and pitching rotation for your team. On game day, you choose your level of involvement. You can retire to the luxury box and make calls to the dugout as needed. Or you can take control of each player, choosing what pitches to throw and when to bunt or go for an extra base. A powerful game engine simulates each pitch of the game based on customized player ratings and over 100 years of historical data, assuring you the maximum realism possible! Baseball Mogul is designed to help you manage your team over many simulated years. Manage your team one day at a time, or let the computer simulate weeks or months at a stretch so you can play for virtual years or decades. As your players age, their abilities mature and decline realistically. Don't forget to build your team for the long term, rather than spending all your money on free agents this season. Watch your team rise and fall in the standings, watch your bank statement, and read the news stories to stay on top of what's happening with all the ball clubs in both leagues. If you pick the right players, manage your finances well, and stick to a winning strategy, your team may win the Championship, and you too may become a Baseball Mogul!

Maybe you prefer the challenge of sailing across the Southern Oceans enduring the fiercest storms they have to offer? Or you just wish to learn to sail but have no access to a boat to do so? With Sailaway you can do all of these things. Sailaway - The Sailing Simulator brings all the world's oceans to the comfort of your PC or Mac for you to experience the ultimate in online virtual sailing! Warning Sailaway is not a game. It is a simulation with an active community of sailors and sailing enthusiasts. There are no targets, goals, quests, sea monsters, health or mini games. Please do not buy Sailaway if you expect otherwise. Sail around the world In Sailaway, the oceans of the planet are simulated with unparalleled accuracy at actual scale. A trip across the Pacific will take months, just as it would on a real boat. With a persistent online world, adjust your settings and your boat will continue to sail even if you aren’t online. Race against others Since all sailboats are in the same world and can see each other, it is also possible to race together. Sailaway has a system in place that will display a start line, race buoys and an automatic finish line. The start countdown is the same as in the real world with flag and sound signals. Races. The race agenda is full of races that are organized by the community of sailors. There are long distance races that will take several days or even months to complete. And of course there are also shorter races where there is more direct interaction between the boats. Race together Instead of all competitors sailing in their own boat, you can also assemble a crew and sail together on 1 boat. To prevent an unfair advantage, race organizers may limit the number of sailors on one boat. Set a record There is also the concept of 'Challenges'. These are laid out tracks that can be sailed at your convenience. The sailor with the fastest time holds the record. You can compare this with the Jules Verne Trophy or the Transatlantic record. Learn to sail The good thing about a simulation is that nothing can go wrong and there are tutorials to get you started with the basics if you need. Feel free to practice until you get the feel for the wind and the position of your sails to make the boat move forward. The simulation can assist by pressing the 'helping hand' button. and it can perform certain tasks for you, so you can focus on one aspect at a time. Optimize sail trim The boats in Sailaway are equipped with a full range of trim lines for each sail. Outhauls, cunninghamholes, barberhaulers, travellers, backstays, everything to give full control over the shape of the sails. This shape will not only change visibly when a trim line is adjusted, but this will also affect airflow and ultimately boat speed just like it would in the real world. Navigate coastal waters Over 500,000 buoys, lights and other seamarks will help you navigate along your favorit coastline. You can plan your trip, set waypoints and avoid shallow areas and rocks.

What begins as a tongue-in-cheek romantic comedy ultimately transforms into an action-packed thrill ride in a war-torn alternate reality, and it’s this drastic-yet-methodical genre twist that makes the final chapter the most highly-revered visual novel of all time. This is a story that will plant seeds in your brain early in the first act that you won’t even notice until they sprout in the third for maximum narrative payoff and crushing emotional impact. Don’t fall for Extra’s cutesy exterior. This series ventures into some of the darkest thematic territory you’ll ever see, and when the final curtain closes, you’ll likely need a forklift to pick your jaw up off the floor. Make no mistake: this is a story that will challenge you in ways few works of fiction dare attempt, and an emotional tour de force unlike any other. This game contains the first two arcs: Extra, and Unlimited . The final arc, Muv-Luv Alternative is the story’s massive climax, and is nearly the size of the first two combined. Muv-Luv Extra Takeru is your average unassuming high school senior whose entire world gets turned upside down one morning when he awakens to find himself in bed with the heiress to one of the world’s largest international conglomerates. She calls herself Meiya, and - despite never having met him before - she insists that the two of them are destined for one another. This comes much to the chagrin of his childhood friend Sumika, the girl next door who’s always had feelings for him, who realizes that if she doesn’t act fast, she might just lose him forever. All of which begs the question: just who is Meiya? And do his feelings for Sumika run deeper than he thought? In the end, he’ll need to decide between the girl who’s been with him through thick and thin, or the stranger who claims they’re bound together by fate. But that’s only one side of the story. Muv-Luv Unlimited Just as the page turns on Takeru’s happily ever after, he awakens one morning in a world not his own. An alternate timeline, humanity on the brink of extinction. A world infested by alien invaders locked in a war that’s been raging on for decades. And yet, all the set pieces are the same - his house is still here, albeit dilapidated and barely standing. His school is still here, though it’s now a military academy. And even though they don’t recognize him, all his friends are here too… with one exception. Was this all just a dream? Or was the world he thought he knew really a dream all along? Muv-Luv Alternative To avoid spoilers, we only recommend visiting Muv-Luv Alternative Steam page after finishing Muv-Luv Unlimited. Features: A Dating Sim - Date any of the heroines, get to know their personalities and backstories, and fall in love with each other!

Every day that passes is the same, and Kotone soon grows tired of her monotonous routine. If only she could enter a world like Asaph, filled with fantastical creatures and frightening monsters… but Asaph Online is only a game. There’s no way a game could ever become a reality.

Order your employees to perform work with the creatures and watch as it unfolds; harness greater energy, and expand the facility. One disaster will lead to another, until everything has fallen into chaos. “I give you a warm welcome to Lobotomy Corporation.” Lobotomy Corporation is a roguelite monster-management simulation. Our game was inspired by the monsters birthed of various inspirations featured in games, film, and series, such as the SCP Foundation, Cabin in the Woods, and Warehouse 13. Going further, it was developed with this thought: “What if those monsters were real, and your job were to manage them?” You will be playing as the Manager of Lobotomy Corporation, a company in which such creatures are contained and managed. Order your employees to perform work with and on the creatures and watch the results expectantly. Gather energy produced by the monsters and fulfill the quota each day, expand the facility, and manage even more strange beings. In this game, the player will face an ever-present sense of tension and dread as they progress through each day. “Our new technology will bring salvation to humanity.” Lobotomy Corporation is a newly established energy company that isolates Abnormalities and extracts an infinite amount of energy from them by using independently developed technology , or so it seems on the outside.

Furthermore, AIs such as Angela and the ‘Sephirot’ will be at your side to provide all the assistance you need for smooth progression. Beings that you must constantly research and observe. We dubbed the creatures that reside in Lobotomy Corporation, ‘Abnormalities’. You will have to try your best to keep your employees out of danger while extracting as much energy as possible from the Abnormalities. However, you must learn what types of work you should and shouldn’t perform via trial and error. You start with zero information on the Abnormalities. At first, your eyes, ears, and the in-game manual will be your only hints. Let your intuition pick the work type that might suit the Abnormality best. After that, order the employee who is best suited for the job to work on the Abnormality, and wait for the results. In the process of managing Abnormalities, you will gain the power of information. The amount of energy you can acquire from Abnormalities will depend heavily on the type of work your employees perform. This is NOT a tycoon. As mentioned before, Abnormalities are beings that need to be treated with great care. Some might dislike the idea of being locked inside a Containment Unit, and may sometimes attempt to breach containment. A breaching Abnormality will attack every employee in sight and disrupt the facility’s systems. Worse still, it could open up other units and cause more Abnormalities to escape. Furthermore, employees eroded or corrupted by certain Abnormalities will have a greatly adverse influence on other employees. Employees brainwashed by Abnormalities might randomly attack those around them, wholly oblivious to what they are doing. In addition, employees may go insane from serious psychic trauma, disobeying your orders and damaging the psyche of other employees around them. One disaster leads to another, until everything has fallen into chaos. If you fail to resolve a situation immediately, it will ultimately spiral out of control and throw the whole facility into chaos. When such a situation does occur, you will have to gather employees to suppress any threat and regain control of the situation, or give up parts of the facility to ensure the company’s safety. “Tell me, manager. Do you have any wishes?” The game consists of two main portions: Monster Management and visual Story Segments. Once a day of managing Abnormalities and producing energy ends, the story segment will follow right afterward. In the Story Segments, dialogue with Angela (the AI you’ll also be seeing occasionally in the management portion of the game) and the Sephirot will play. As you progress through the missions they give, you will come closer to the truth hidden deep in the company. You may have to ask questions, or answer questions from others. Here, you will uncover the secrets surrounding the company and yourself, and mayhaps even more. “Hello, X.” “I give you a warm welcome to Lobotomy Corporation.”",21261,531312.39,17515,2092,1,True,2018

The ambition grows with the experience: Now the multiplayer is played under real conditions – the colleagues in the control centre coordinate by radio, the game leader set challenges in the middle of the road, unpredictable weather, real duty rosters and long shifts.

Play as Sofya Rykov, a private investigator with a secret of her own: she’s the only Human who can wield magic. Each episode is a narrative-heavy adventure game with branching story-lines and a standalone plot. Sofya’s loyalty grows divided when she is hired for one job and blackmailed into another. Sofya’s childhood love and the Emperor’s daughter, Katerina, seeks her protection from threats near the border. Katerina’s rival Nikolai, a ruthless local politician, needs a dangerous drug stolen from the powerful Krovakyn Church and has the leverage to force Sofya to do it. All the while, Katerina and Nikolai clash over control over the city—and Sofya’s heart. Large segments of The Last Sacrament will play as a point and click adventure game with dialogue in the traditional style of a visual novel. But unlike earlier Woodsy Studio games, The Last Sacrament also features an in-world tabletop RPG called RiftRealms. Inspired by story-focused pen and paper games, Sofya will play RiftRealms games with various supporting characters as dungeon master. Players will both build a character in RiftRealms to fight increasingly more powerful foes, and learn about the key players in Sofya’s life through how they choose to tell a RiftRealms story. While the characters of Echoes of the Fey play RiftRealms with Sofya, they reveal their own prejudices and beliefs through their strategies. They serve as “dungeon masters” who try to create a gaming experience for Sofya (and thus the player) that is both entertaining and challenging. Kind and compassionate characters like Heremon might slip up by making the game too easy, while ruthless characters like Arkady transform the game into a harrowing experience. Despite her hardships, Sofya gets many chances to find love amidst her adventures. She can forge a romantic bond with Nikolai, Heremon, Katerina, or Arkady as she tries to escape the dangers of her predicament.",12,167.88,12,2000,22,True,2018

You'll strive to conquer volumetric planets against an AI or other players. Some planets are as you would expect: flat, hilly, covered by oceans. Others ... not so much. Feel free to design your own. Sometimes you will need to build bridges to reach your destination. Or it may be strategically useful to excavate tunnels or caves ... or to blow up a mountain.

Resources never deplete, but the quest for ever more also never ends. And literally undermining someone else's mines can be surprisingly effective.

The real deal starts the morning after, and this is the exact time when you, dear player enter the cruel world of Out of Reach . Although the archipelago was considered deserted before ships started to crash into sea rocks nearby, every kind of area on the island has its natural inhabitants who just don't give a warm welcome. Thinking twice every time before moving ahead could be one of the smartest things to do. Staying on a beach after crushing your boat allows you to hunt for slowly moving animals and gives the ability to see at long distances. Disadvantage - you can be seen from exactly the same distance and there's always someone to call you his own slow-moving food. In order to stay on the top of the food chain, you need to work harder than others. Everything starts from finding certain resources. Chop trees, mine stone, gather flax and food. Equip yourself and start searching for more sophisticated materials like copper and tin to produce bronze and other alloys. Use a variety of workshops, furnaces and tools to craft armour and weapons. Check which combination of gear has better performance and suits your game style best. Upgrade equipment using new resources or items obtained in battle. Store, collect or trade your stuff with other players! Looking for a place to store your timber or a quiet and cosy room to forge a sword and tan a skin of an elephant? Build your own stronghold! Use dozens of building elements like walls, stairs and floors to assemble the house of your dreams in an environment of your choice... or just take control of one. The best solutions to problems are most often invented during battles. Everyday life on islands full of castaways is not an exception. To successfully protect your territory or gain control of a new one, you will need the advantage. Ballista The greater the distance, the safer you are. Ballista may be slow to load and unable to move but the ability to pierce a target with a 1,5m dart few hundred meters away in no time shouldn't be underestimated. Trebuchet Unusual situations require extraordinary solutions. When an axe doesn't help or doors are just too thick it's time for a trebuchet. Construction costs both time and resources but nothing surprises like a forced entry through a wall. Traps Well, there's actually one thing that surprises more - a tricky and deadly trap! Use trip wires at the doors, stairs or wherever you want, connect them with ballistae or boulder throwers, place a bait and wait for the unwelcome guests. Glider When everything fails, you might consider an attack from above.

Daedalic Complex is an adventure, RPG, dungeon-crawling game with elements of enjoyable storytelling and harsh survival. In this game, a player is required to find an exit for each stage by means of meeting certain conditions such as triggering all the switches hidden separately within the map. The player takes a role of one of the prisoners in Gildersvine, a kingdom in its prosperity through highly-developed mining industry. One day, a chance to walk free out of the imprisonment facility is given to the prisoner, in condition of winning a certain game held within Daedalic Complex where one has to find a piece of pardoning paper hidden deep inside the facility. The prisoner had no other options but to accept the offer, because there was no other way left. Still, practically every single thing in Daedalic Complex works against the protagonist(s) on the quest for his/her own freedom. Withstanding cruel level-designs of each stage, exhausting combats with hideous monsters, running-low resources, and grueling survival conditions, the one involved in this cruel game has to find every possible means of achieving his/her ultimate goal, the pardoning paper. Even there exists a moment of making a crucial choice where one's fate, be it seeing the light of outside once again or meeting the certain doom, should be determined. To do so, one is required to explore, scavenge, and thus survive this whole Daedalic Complex. Dare to explore deep inside the dungeon, but be cautious of your remaining scarce resources and companions while doing so. Gather all the things needed for survival, but expect that none of them will be given freely nor easily. Find the exit that leads you out of each stage, but still, you will have to survive first.

34377,覇県を握れ ～47都道府県大戦～,2018-11-22,39.99,0,Flying Panjandrum / ふらいんぐパンジャンドラム,Flying Panjandrum / ふらいんぐパンジャンドラム,"Indie,Simulation,Strategy",日本最強の都道府県を決める戦いが幕を開ける！ 最強の経済力を持つ東京都か、最強の軍事力を持つ北海道か、最強の工業力を持つ愛知県か、それとも……。 統計データをもとに再現した47都道府県。果たして、覇県を握るのはどこだ！？ ◆ゲーム概要 47の都道府県から１つ選び、内政、外交、軍事をフル活用して、天下一の都道府県を目指すのが目的。 財政難と戦争の波に飲まれて消えていくか、それとも日本を制するかは、県知事である君の手にかかっている！ ◆財政 本作は実際の都道府県の財政状況を再現しているため、ほぼ全ての勢力が赤字だ。地方交付税交付金は降ってこないので、自らの手で財源を確保する必要がある。 経済発展に力を入れるのはもちろんの事、地方債を発行したり、税率を調整しなければ生き残る事はできない。しかし地方債を乱発すれば財政再建は遠のき、税率を上げれば人口が流出するだろう。 タックスヘイブンを実施して他県から人を呼び込んでみるか？ それとも、預金封鎖で県民から搾り取りながら軍拡に励むか？ 様々な戦略が考えられる。 ◆電力 電力は重要な戦略資源だ。不足すると経済が麻痺し、財政破綻に直結する。 東京都のように規模に見合った発電所を備えていない県は、他県から融通してもらうか、併合するなりして電力を確保しなければならない。 ◆外交 どの県と仲良くするべきか、どこを滅ぼすつもりか、脅威になりそうな県はどこか。 生き残るには、自身の戦略と日本の情勢をもとに外交を展開しなければならない。 都道府県の実力差は大きく、外交ミスは即滅亡に繋がる。 しかし巧みな外交を展開すれば、弱小県でも覇県を握るチャンスはある。 ◆合併 他の戦略SLGではまず見かけられない要素として、都道府県間の合併があげられる。 合併を繰り返せば、武力に訴えなくても勢力を拡大できる。 しかしながら、合併相手の債務残高も引き継ぐので、財政再建は困難になってしまう。 また平和的な合併でも、領土の拡張は他県を警戒させてしまうだろう。 もちろんAI同士の合併にも目を光らせておくべきだ。戦争相手が合併により突如巨大化……なんて事になったら目も当てられない。外交関係に介入して、合併を阻止しよう。 ◆戦争 戦争が最善手とは限らない。 他県を占領しても、悲しいことに赤字県が多く財政改善には結びつきにくい(特に地方)。また戦争状態の県に住みたいと思う住人はおらず、人口の流出を招く危険もある。 しかし他県を占領すれば県勢が強まり外交をより有利に運べるようになり、産業設備などもごっそり手に入る。うまく仕掛ければ、覇県を握る近道になるだろう。 もちろん望まない戦争に巻き込まれる事も多々ある。どんな場合でも戦争に備えなければならない。 ◆陸軍 陸軍は工業力で生産するため、愛知のような工業県は陸軍大国になりうる。また初期戦力なら北海道がダントツで一位である。 いかに海軍力と空軍力が高くても、首都エリアを落とされると負けなので、最も重要な戦力と言える。 歩兵、砲兵、高射、戦車、ヘリ部隊を運用して敵を打ち負かそう。 ◆海軍 軍港を持つ青森、神奈川、京都、広島、長崎は、ゲーム開始時から広範囲の制海権を握っている。 制海権をとっていると、外交上の影響力を発揮しやすくなる。 また無慈悲な海上封鎖も行える。敵のあらゆる産業を停止に追い込み、その末路は財政破綻による滅亡である。 ◆空軍 実態が航空自衛隊のため、対艦攻撃を得意としているが、必要であれば航空阻止や産業基盤に対する爆撃もこなす。 海軍にも言えることだが、効果的な運用にはレーダーサイトなどによる電子支援が必須だ。 ◆謀略戦 直接的な武力攻撃以外にも、謀略戦が可能。 ふるさと納税をしかけて、相手の税収を奪う。 サイバー攻撃により敵の経済を破壊。 企業誘致で産業を奪う。 クーデーターを扇動し、内政が脆弱な敵を滅亡させる。 陸空海と謀略戦を組み合わせて他県を打ち負かそう。 ◆イデオロギー 軍事に特化した「覇権」 経済発展を追求する「繁栄」 外交に特化した「平和」 平和憲法破棄、県境封鎖、経済特区、社会保障改革、平和都市宣言……。イデオロギーによって個性豊かな政策スキルが採用可能。 またどのイデオロギーを採用するかによって、外交関係が大きく変化する。 ◆多様な勝利条件 覇県(勝利)とは、武力で天下統一を果たす事とは限らない。 初期エリアを巨大都市にする首都勝利。 財政健全化による財政再建勝利。 占領や合併で領土を広げて領土勝利。 自分以外のイデオロギーを全て滅ぼす、イデオロギー勝利。 大国を築くか、他県を弱体化させて総合力勝利。 どの手段で覇県を握るのが向いているかは、県によって異なる。 例えば東京都で首都勝利を収めるのは簡単だが、鳥取県ではとてつもなく難しい。 沖縄県は陸路で繋がっていないため領土の拡張が絶望的に難しいが、引きこもって財政再建を目指すのにはうってつけ。 北海道は膨大な初期軍備で、一気に南下して領土勝利を掴むのに向いている。 都道府県の性質と戦略を見極め、覇県を握れ！ 県勢再現へのこだわり 各県のパラメーターは、様々な統計データを元に設定している。 人口 経済力 → 県内総生産(内閣府) 地方債を除いた赤字率 → 財政力指数(総務省) 食糧生産量 → 食料自給率(農林水産省) 発電量 → 都道府県別発電実績(資源エネルギー庁)など 工業力 → 製造品出荷額等(経済産業省) 造船力 → ドックサイズ推定合計値(独自調査)、造船業の現状(国土交通省) 製油 → 製油所の所在地と原油処理能力(石油連盟) 初期石油量 → 国家石油備蓄基地の規模(独立行政法人石油天然ガス・金属鉱物資源機構) 魅力度 → 転出入者の割合(総務省統計局)など 初期軍備 → 自衛隊の推定配備量(Wikipedia等) 兵站設備 → 自衛隊の司令部や補給施設の有無(Wikipedia等) レーダー → 自衛隊のレーダーの施設の有無(Wikipedia等) 造船力のような統計が存在しない項目に関しても、できる限り調査して再現を試みている。 具体的には日本全国の造船所の公式ページを片っ端から見る。ドックの数や容積を公表している会社はその数値を拾う。情報がない場合は衛星写真でドックを探し出し、縦横の長さから推定容積を算出し、都道府県ごとに合算。これを47都道府県分繰り返す。 本作を遊べば、ゲームを通じて都道府県の実力を知る事ができるだろう。 体験版(Demo)について 高価かつ複雑なゲームなので、まずは体験版で動作テストや、肌に合うかをお確かめください。 体験版は3年目の冒頭まで、全ての県で遊べます。またセーブデータは、同じパソコンなら自動で製品版に引き継がれます。 ------------------------勢力例--------------------------- 北海道 「手元には最強の軍隊がある。他県を'開拓'してやろうではないか！」 かつての対ソ防衛の関係で、最も分厚く自衛隊が配備されている。本作ではロシアと不可侵条約でも結んだのか、全戦力を南下に使えるようになっている。 ゲーム開始時の陸上戦力は、推定で東京都の17倍、島根県の290倍。さらに強力な空軍も擁する。もちろん食糧生産力も日本一。 その一方で財政赤字の金額は日本最悪。だだっ広い北の大地は、除雪費、空調費、インフラ維持費等でもりもり税金を溶かす。さすが「試される大地」と言われるだけの事はある。 日本を制するか、それとも財政赤字に呑み込まれて破産するかは、知事の腕次第だ。 東京都 「東京都の血税が、地方交付税交付金として田舎にばらまかれる事はもうない。」 巨大な人口と県内総生産を擁する日本の首都。その経済力は圧倒的で鳥取県のおよそ50倍。 ただし食料自給率は驚異の1%。さらに致命的な事に、電力は他県に頼っており、単独ではその力を発揮する事ができない。 そして高い魅力度により、他県から人口が流入するため、ただでさえ足りない電力がますます足りなくなる。 食糧不足と電力不足で機能不全を起こしたまま財政破綻を迎えるか、それとも首都としての貫禄を見せて覇県を握るかは、都知事である君の手にかかっている。 奈良県 「鹿せんべい食うか？」 全国で唯一陸上自衛隊の駐屯地がない県。航空自衛隊も実戦部隊はなく、内陸県なので当然海上自衛隊もいない。 さらに言うと、一人あたりの県内総生産は日本最下位(2016年基準)。 工業力も軍備も経済もないうえに、隣には強豪の大阪府がいる。 果たして古都の復活なるか……？ 沖縄県 「今こそ、その苦汁をナイチャーにも味わわせるのだ！シマンチュよ立ち上がれ！」 当たり前だが、陸路で何県とも繋がっていない。 敵陸上部隊に攻められる心配は一切ないが、こちらも攻めれない。 この状況からどう覇県を握るかが、県知事の腕の見せどころ。 愛知県 「他県に自動車をもっと買ってもらわなければ。」 織田信長、豊臣秀吉、徳川家康。戦国三大武将を生み出した愛知県は、現代でも強力だ。 圧倒的１位の工業力を活かして、もりもり軍備が増強できる。 さらに経済力、電力等も高いレベルでまとまっており、何よりも周りは自分より弱い県ばかり。 織田信長のごとく、勢力を拡大していこう。   愛媛県 「願わくは、全国あまねく家庭の蛇口を捻ればポ○ジュースである。」 よく愛知県と間違えられる。 前作「四国志シリーズ」では、四国最強の県として君臨していたが、あくまで強いのは四国の中だけ。そもそも四国四県を足した所で、大阪どころか兵庫県の工業力や県内総生産にも届かないのでしかたない。 香川県と四国のリーダーを争うだけで終わるのか、それとも本土に進出できるかは県知事である君の手にかかっている。,9,359.91,9,1865,0,True,2018
