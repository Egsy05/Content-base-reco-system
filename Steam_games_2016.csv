Some of its key features include: 'mazing' 'Mazing' is the art of filling a wide-open space in a tower defense game with your towers to build the longest possible path (the maze) that the enemy's units must travel before reaching your throne. 'Mazing' is a core skill in Shepherds of the Abyss, and it's put to the test with random obstacles and waypoints spawned each game to prevent you from memorizing the strongest maze setup. unique Unit Buffs Every unit in Shepherds of the Abyss is granted various buffs with significant strengths, such as making them heavily armored, increasing their movement speed, granting them high regeneration, or giving them shields. The towers all provide hard counters to these buffs, so building the correct towers in optimal locations is key to success. empowering towers Shepherds of the Abyss is a dual resource tower defense game. Gold is used to build and upgrade, while the power of souls you've collected from dying units is used to empower towers on a wave to wave basis. Empowering towers unleashes additional strength and functionality to help them overcome the units' buffs. For example, some towers gain damage over time while others snare units they attack. round Separation Gameplay is separated into multiple phases - Preparation Phase, where all building, upgrading, and empowering is done, and then Combat Phase, where units attack all players at once and souls are harvested. Incoming Wave Manipulation All of the buffs possessed by the incoming wave of units appear in a grid during Preparation Phase (see screenshots above). Buffs that are adjacent multiply each other's strength, so it's important to move matching buffs apart. However, the movements of these buffs are limited, so you must study the entire grid and make your moves carefully. included Game Modes: Single-player Survival - survive as many waves as possible. Cooperative Survival - survive as many waves as possible with the help of a friend. Head-to-Head - play against another player in a 1v1 battle.",22,131.78,2,2599,19,True,2016

12255,"Gremlins, Inc.",2016-03-10,14.99,692,Charlie Oscar Lima Tango Interactive Entertainment,The Merchant Guild of Rund (Limited),"Indie,Strategy","This is an intense strategy board game in a steampunk world of corrupt capitalist gremlins who compete for money, political power and prestige. Save and invest, steal and extort, arrest and get arrested – in single-player and multiplayer, with ranks and ladders, team mode and spectator mode. Featuring seasonal content updates, regular tournaments, item drops, full support of Steam Community Market – and more! HOW DO YOU PLAY THIS GAME? Gremlins, Inc. is designed for up to 6 players, in multiplayer or in single-player mode (with AI bots). Each player has 6 cards on their hand (replenished from the same deck) and uses them either to move around the playing field or to perform different game actions. There is a lot of interaction with other players, and duels are significantly different from 3-player or 4-player games. You can play until a certain score limit, or until agreed number of rounds, or for time limit. The game offers both custom and ranked sessions (with matchmaking by rating). CAN YOU PLAY IN TEAMS OR JUST WATCH? Yes, you can! In addition to custom sessions (where you define the parameters of the session and may optionally set filters for those who can join you) and password-protected private sessions (so that you and your friends can play undisturbed), the game offers team mode (2x2, 3x3, or 2x2x2) with teams of human players and/or AI bots. Gremlins, Inc. also supports a built-in spectator mode , which allows you to watch sessions of other players right from inside of the game, sharing your emotions with players and other spectators through messages and emoticons. CAN YOU PLAY THIS GAME OFFLINE? Certainly! When you buy this game, you get 2 products in your Steam Library: Gremlins, Inc. – the edition that is playable online in single-player and multiplayer modes, with full support of item drops and Steam Workshop; and Gremlins vs Automatons – the edition that is playable offline in single-player mode, without any connection to our server whatsoever. HOW LONG DOES IT TAKE TO PLAY ONE SESSION? The game offers different session settings to make them fit your available time, and single-player mode offers automatic SAVE / LOAD function at every turn so that you can take a break whenever you want (while multiplayer mode offers re-connect functionality as long as the session is still in progress). A quick duel for 20 score points with a fast timer can finish in under 20 minutes, while a 4-player session for 60 rounds can last for 2 hours or more. SHORT-TERM AND LONG-TERM STRATEGIES? There are different types of cards in the game (permanent, regular, secret and criminal) and as each card can be used either to move or for action, you will develop both short-term and long-term strategies for making the most out of where you are, and what you currently have in your hand. Normally, you spend half of your game time accumulating resources and building the foundation for the end-game, and the other half trying to control the progress of your opponents (stealing, arresting, initiating player conflicts, and so on). The more you play, the more new strategies you will discover – especially when combining the effects of several cards played in a combination. MAKE DECISIONS, PLAN YOUR MOVES This is an intense strategy game : make decisions at every round! Plan your moves, then adjust to the actions of the other players and new cards drawn. The design of the playing field and the multiple layers of optional features (that you can turn on or off, as you wish) allow for a variety of strategies. The more you play, the more roads to victory you discover, using a combination of features based on the particular setup of the session. The game offers a diverse resource system that allows for many comeback chances even after you're robbed or arrested (or both). With score, money, votes, malice, income and bribes, the tension often remains until the very last round. The multilayer mode of the game features a system of ratings , ladders and ranked sessions : compete in a specific league, and take part in the regularly organised tournaments with over 1 000 participants. A system of anonymous masks allows everyone to compete on equal terms in a ranked session. Every season since its release in 2016, the game receives FREE content and feature updates (balancing changes, new cards, new in-game items, new music). We are committed to continue developing this product – based on player feedback! Additionally, the game offers over 10 single-player challenges plus the option to create custom single-player sessions with different settings and a different mix of AI bots. Finally, there's the team mode where victory is determined not only by strategic skill, but also by communication and coordination of each team, which is an entirely different layer of game mechanics. FACTS &amp; FIGURES 201 cards in the main deck (171 of them – unique): permanent, regular, secret and criminal, each with a hand-drawn steampunk illustration; with each Season update, we keep adding several new cards to the deck. 40 events in the Misfortune deck : these are the special events triggered at certain moments in the game, and may affect the current standing of all players to a significant degree, especially when used on a specific opponent. 6 special Chaos Cards : this is an optional set of cards available to every player in the game; turn them on or off to change the dynamics of the session. 12 sets of Character Abilities : another optional feature that brings to the game special game mechanics unique to each character type; playing with these makes different competing strategies even more pronounced. 11 original locations : the Office, the Plant, the Dump, the Marketplace, the Inferno, the Jail, the Casino, the Court, the Treasure, the Bank and the Astral Plane; and 7 original spot types : Risk, Gamble, Police, Income, Bribe, Misfortune and Tribune. 2 distinctly different playing fields : The Clockwork Town and The Clockwork Colony, each offering strategic challenges of their own. Finally, the game took us three years to develop from concept to full release, and we're still committed to continue supporting the community through development of new content. There are currently over 150 000 players of Gremlins, Inc. on Steam from all over the world, including USA, Russia, China, Japan, UK and France. Collectively, players already launched several millions game sessions! FINALLY, WHO ARE THE GREMLINS? You think that’s just a pocket watch in your hand, a watch that’s a bit late because you keep forgetting to wind it up? No, no and no – you couldn’t be further from the truth! What you carry around is a whole gremlin town packed into this tiny mechanism: a town with its own bank, its own casino… and even its own jail! Gremlins are the microscopic creatures that inhabit any mechanism that they can possibly infiltrate. If a watch or a telescope malfunctions, then it’s probably due to gremlins who took up a residence there. More than anything in life, gremlins value money , political power and prestige : prestige that one can claim after completing some sort of a grandiose engineering project. Aside from working on their own projects, gremlins mostly spend their time preventing other gremlins from building something even more grandiose. This they achieve through bribing officials and lying to the electorate, as well through stealing from their competitors - and outright arresting them. A DISCLAIMER (JUST IN CASE) We felt it important to note that Gremlins, Inc. is not a free-to-play game. Also, this is not a CCG or TCG: you do not need to buy boosters or packs; in every session the game offers the same deck to every player, and everyone's chances are equal. OUR DLC POLICY We released Gremlins, Inc. on Steam in Early Access at the end of 2015. Since then, we released over 100 game updates as we continue to add more content and more features as well as improve the overall player experience. This is what we typically add to the game with the regular free updates of the game: * new features and new mechanics * new cards and new Misfortunes * new music tracks and new game themes (for special occasions such as Lunar New Year) These seasonal updates are available to every owner of the game for FREE, regardless of DLC ownership. And this is what we release as paid DLC: * new character portraits and player tokens * new music tracks and new game themes * new trails, frames and emoticons * new single-player content If you enjoy Gremlins, Inc., you can support our development efforts by purchasing its DLC. However, there is absolutely no pressure to own any of the extra content in order to play the game or compete in the tournaments. STEAM COMMUNITY MARKET, CRAFTING AND ITEM STORE Gremlins, Inc. features in-game items and fully supports Steam Community Market . While playing the game, certain actions will trigger random chest drops with items of varying rarity: it could be a new emoticon, a new profile background, a new music track, or one of the dozens of other cosmetic items. These items are FREE, yours to use or trade on Steam Community Market . We, the developer, do not engage in the direct sales of any drop items; only players can trade them. The game also supports crafting : once you find a blueprint of a specific item, you can create as many such items as you wish, as long as you have the required number of charges (you get charges when you convert other in-game items that you do not want, or have multiple copies of). Finally, the game has its own Steam Item Store where we sell a very small number of unique items that influence the item meta-game (but they have no effect on the game mechanics). ONLINE &amp; OFFLINE VERSIONS Gremlins, Inc. was designed as a digital board game with the multiplayer mode at its heart. However, this is not to say that we don't like single-player – we do, and there's a separate section with the single-player challenges as well as the mode where you can create any custom single-player session that you like! One of the products that you receive with this game, Gremlins, Inc. , features both single-player and multiplayer modes, and requires that your game client is connected to both Steam and the game's server at all times – in order to support item drops, Steam Community Market and Steam Workshop. The other product that is included with the game, Gremlins vs Automatons , features single-player mode and is designed specifically to be played offline.",7329,109861.71,4923,2852,108,True,2016

A quick announcement from Team Kismet: Since releasing Kismet as a VR title, we have been extremely grateful to receive such a positive response. However, because there are so many more PC owners out there in the world who are still yet to adopt VR, we wanted to find a way to get Kismet to them as well. For that reason, we have added in a third launch option, in addition to HTC Vive and Oculus Rift -- a new non-VR version. We have also dropped the price and added subtitles for English, French, Spanish, German and Japanese. (VR versions will also now feature these subtitles.) The below description is still accurate to the game, and anyone on Steam who has purchased Kismet in the past or purchases it in the future will have access to the VR and non-VR versions. Would you like to know what the future holds in store for you? Put on your Oculus Rift or HTC Vive headset and take part in a first-of-its-kind VR experience: Kismet . Developed by award-winning creative studio Psyop, Kismet is a collection of three activities, including a past-present-future Tarot Card reading (“ The Cards ”), daily Astrology session (“ The Stars ”), and ancient boardgame Ur (“ A Game of Wit ”). Powered by a deck of 22 hand-painted Tarot cards and an accurate real-time map of the solar system, Kismet is meant to be experienced daily, with unique outcomes that are directly tied to not only the cards that you choose, but your birthday and the actual alignment of celestial bodies at the time of your reading. Seated across a table from an enchanted automaton with the power to look into the future, you’ll be transported to a place where magic is real, brought to life in a beautifully detailed, handmade, Gothic style. Attention Oculus Rift Users: Kismet is available in two versions, one for Vive and one for Rift. To launch the Rift version, you need to find the game in your Library, right click it, and launch it in the 'Other VR' mode (as opposed to Vive mode). If you accidentally launch Vive mode, such as through an icon created during the game's Steam installation process, the game will be unable to find your Xbox controller. Attention HTC Vive Users: Because Kismet is a sitting experience in a room scale environment, we recommend that you find a comfortable place to sit down and then reset your seated position at that point. To do that on the Vive, push the bottom button on your motion controller to bring up the Steam menu, aim at the Settings cog at the bottom of the menu, pull the trigger, and select 'Reset Seated Position' from the General VR Settings menu. After that, you can move your head around to inspect the details of the environment and take advantage of positional audio within the experience. Kismet is designed to work with each individual headset's bundled controllers. On Vive it is compatible with motion control, on Rift it is compatible with Microsoft Xbox One gamepad. Kismet has multiple graphics quality settings which are bound to the keyboard. The Lowest quality setting is mapped to the '1' key, Medium is set to '2', and the High graphics setting is mapped to '3'. Kismet's default render quality is set to '2' Medium, and will run on minimum specification hardware.

One user described it as 'A million musical leeches, waiting to suck the serotonin from my brain.' Another said 'I don't even know what to say about this one. It honestly freaked me out a little.' A particularly enthusiastic user stated 'Wish I had some kind of supercomputer to push the limits on this thing... I'm pretty sure it would reveal the secrets of the universe.' A Fine Art Game Anomalies is an experimental generative art game. There are no levels, points or objectives. It is a 'game' in the loosest sense of being an amusement or pastime, an interactive piece of audio-visual, virtual sculpture, which one can tinker around with and explore. Generate and Explore You can randomly generate the anomalies, or you can change the anomaly's parameters manually with a series of sliding dials in order to tweak your creation. Use the controls to explore Anomalies, and the unique sights and sounds they generate. Sights and Sounds Anomalies are both audio and visual phenomena, the parameters that effect one effect the other. Some are strange and discordant entities, while others are symmetrical and harmonious. All the images and 'songs' you hear in the demo video were produced through the program's algorithms. Other Options Using a built in screen capture button, you can collect snapshots of your handiwork. Use it as desktop wallpaper, or share it with your friends. If you want to revisit a favorite anomaly, you can also save it and load it again later. There is also an auto timer feature that cycles through anomalies automatically, allowing you to sit back and enjoy the show. Experimental I call Anomalies 'experimental' because of the way in which I developed it. I started with a simple idea - 'what would trees look like if they grew in space?' - and began to create fairly simple, branching structures. Once that was working, I thought about different colors and textures. Each stage brought new questions and possibilities - 'what if they move or wiggle? What it they make sounds? What if they produce flames or particles?' - and so on, until I arrived at what you see in the program. So I had no idea what it would end up like when I started it. Though I have moved on to other projects, I still think about more possibilities for Anomalies. I do hope to be able to return to working on this program at some point, but I will not give any promises right now...",50,49.5,32,2620,4,True,2016

If you can read this, be it on a PC, a laptop or even a tablet, you probably have everything you need. Additional controllers are supported, but not required unless you prefer to have a little more elbow room. The game can be set up in seconds, even for 12 players at once. Rounds take about 5 minutes each. 12 orbits is friendly, competitive and a little chaotic. It is simple enough to quickly teach a group how to play it, but varied and deep enough to keep them entertained for a long time.

The purpose is to survive for 180 seconds in a Psychedelic tunnel by dodging the obstacles. The primary gameplay is that sometimes Zag will go through colored walls that will reverse your controls. With this unique and evil mechanic; 'it won’t be your reflexes that let you down, it’ll be your concentration – as control reversals mean you’ll constantly have to keep track of what’s up and what’s down (and left and right). You control a Zag as he hurtles down multi-colored, gyrating tunnels packed with obstacles and (worst of all) zones that reverse your controls. The obstacles aren’t that hard to avoid themselves, but the zones that reverse your controls really mess with your mind. You can have the best timing in the world, but if you’re pressing the wrong button, you’re going to be one flat cat. Zag does change color to give you some indication of which controls are reversed, but with so much happening on-screen, that doesn’t make things much easier!' -Alphabetagamer Features: - The most evil game you will ever play - 2 tutorials - 1 survival mode - 1 epic Answer",223,220.77,137,2911,9,True,2016

The pursuit of strength can take its toll on a man's soul, and at the end of it all, will you still be capable of happiness, and love? This is a story of perserverence. Hope has evaporated from the land. Even those who do not directly oppose you will cast doubt upon your intentions... but with every opponent mercilessly cut down, your will hardens and the voices of doubt grow more faint. ...but in the pursuit of greatness, will you remember why you started?",32,127.68,26,2601,8,True,2016

That means many aspects of it are still rough around the edges, or are just plain missing. We rely on the community model of testing and iterating with our customers, so if you’re looking for a finished product, you should wait for our full release later this year. Seriously, this is a WORK IN PROGRESS. Most simply put, XLR is a multiplayer team based arena shooter. In the world of XLR, a future humanity is fighting for its survival as companion AI has become the dominant life form. Some AI have deemed humanity a scourge worth wiping out, while other AI have deemed humanity an endangered species worth preserving and honoring as the AI progenitors. Most remaining human factions have banded together under a new super banner called the Earth Recovery Consortium (ERC) to pool resources and form strike teams for continued survival. Their most frequently pressing objectives are to raid hostile AI-controlled facilities for energy, technology, and supplies. While most of humanity agrees that ERC goals must always be met for continued survival (ERC goals coming soon to matches), invariably every sub-faction has its own side agendas for each mission, in hopes of one day wresting control from the other side of the AIER war. You’ll party up into factions (with friends, or just join a random match), then land in a drop ship with your strike team at an enemy facility. After selecting a metaframe for your consciencess to intertwine with symbiotically, your team will deploy to various battlegrounds. Don’t worry, If you need some training, you can always go up against some simulated enemy combatants in singleplayer training mode. Choose to play as any of 9 player classes: Hawk : Like to plan and strike from afar? Then this is the metaframe for you. Keep tabs on the enemy by tagging them with your binoculars , then take them out from a distance with your sniper rifle . Or deploy your holodouble to mislead the enemy, then silently strike from behind with your knife . Locomotion: slide Slayer : Are you a tried and true Soldier at heart? If so, get down to brass tacks with your laser rifle and laser pistol . Engage in close quarters combat with your machete , or toss out a timed grenade to break up a fight. Locomotion: slide Bliss : A monk that seeks the answer to one question: “Why are you hurting yourself?” (coming soon) Shadow : Are you like ninja? Move about with stealth, using your zipline baton . Then Cut down your enemies with your katana . If need be, slow them down at range with your throwing knives (coming soon) , or vanish in a puff of smoke with one of your smoke bombs (coming soon) . Locomotion: slide or zipline Logi : A futurist who is going to be a LOT of fun. (coming soon) Tang : Take an aggressive stance with your minigun and shotgun . Then incite a little mayhem and confusion with your gravity knuckles (coming soon) and gravitronic grenade (coming soon) . Locomotion: slide Thermo : Feeling a little moody? Burninate everything in sight with your flamethrower . When things get too hot, flip the barrel around to activate your freeze pistol (coming soon) . Throw in an incendiary grenade for good measure, and finish up with a dash of thermo mace (coming soon) . Locomotion: slide Ballisto : If you love calculating angles and bounce shots then this is the metaframe for you. Wreak havoc with your grenade launcher , then charge in with your plasma pistol (coming soon) . Don’t forget to maximize damage with your warhammer (coming soon) and proximity mine (coming soon) . Locomotion: slide Zoner : When you're in the mood for some good old fashioned flow state, just pull out this metaframe’s dual pistols .

Please let us know in the forums what your experience with it is. We recognize that some players are more prone to motion sickness than others, so we’ve taken steps to ensure that you never have to use the slide locomotion mechanic if you don’t want to.

8923,WeaponizedChess,2016-07-29,6.99,0,Arational Entertainment,Arational Entertainment,"Casual,Indie,Strategy","New Version Available 2/12/18:Windows, fully animated graphics, online multiplayer with your Steam Friends Weaponized Chess = chess + weapons WeaponizedChess is like regular chess but in 3-D with weapons and stealth. WeaponizedChess is derived from regular chess but makes many changes. It adds weapons, three-dimensionality, and tunable stealth. It is a more modern version of chess. Old chess is about knights capturing kings. Modern war is not like that at all. WeaponizedChess is about stealthy, weapon-armed pieces contending on a modern battlefield. Have no fear, the basic nature of chess is retained: black-and-white checkerboard, one side moves then the other, defeating the enemy king is still the goal. WeaponizedChess is also an experiment in creating a game where a human player will always have an advantage over the artificial-intelligence player. This is achieved by deliberately and radically increasing the exponential burden of a computer player but in a way that any human can naturally handle. Humans will always be better guessers than computers and stealth (and other features of the game) ensheathe this nature into the game. You don't like playing chess by mail or email remotely with someone because you fear they may cheat (get advice from a chess-playing computer program)? Play this game instead. Tired of playing chess against people who have spent a lot of time building up book knowledge about chess? Play this game instead. WeaponizedChess has an integrated board editor, a type of game notation which describes a game, a set of known popular color themes, and a set of pre-defined starting boards. WeaponizedChess is a game for people played chess in the past but got bored with it. Did you ever look at your present position during a regular chess game and wish you could move two pieces instead of just one? In WeaponizedChess you can often move more than 1 of your pieces during your turn. Modern conflict is heavily dependent on military technology. In WeaponizedChess there are choppers, jets, tanks, submarines, destroyers, and combat engineers whose characteristics have been translated to a chess board. Low-observable assets play a deadly game of cat and mouse with an opponent. Infantrymen use jump-packs to fly over the battlefield. Combat scuba invisibly travels under the surface to attack. There are 2 versions available on Steam. In the Linux/SteamOS version you play against a computer opponent or against another human. Human versus human play requires both players be in the same physical room and share the computer to make moves. This version of WeaponizedChess does not provide online multi-player matchmaking. Note that a typical AI for a regular chess game is comparatively better because an army of researchers and programmers have been working for decades to achieve this result. The 2nd, newer version runs on Windows, provides fully-animated computer graphics, and allows you play a game online with your Steam friends. This version does NOT provide a computer opponent. There is only 1 package for sale. When you buy this package you get both the Windows version and the Linux/SteamOS version. If you have 45 Gigabytes and 45 minutes available you can put Linux on your Windows PC and get both the online multiplayer and AI opponent on one computer! You might wonder 'Why should I want to buy this game?' Curiosity. One reason might be because you would be interested in seeing what regular chess would be like if it was changed to include weapons. In this game you can change options to make the board pieces move very much like regular chess pieces but they will also be able to use weapons. There are many other ways to modify the game but it would take too much text to describe them all. After you modify how you want the game to play you can save your preferences. You can set the game to automatically load your preferences whenever the game starts. You can also modify and save to your preferences for how you want the game to look as opposed to how it plays . There are many videos showing what this game looks like (on YouTube) but in this Steam version there are two modifications to how the game looks. Instead of the 2 piece sets shown in the videos and web-viewable game art there are now 13 piece sets available. Also you can use a set of known 'popular' color themes to change the colors of the game board and game pieces. The AI works better if you use an i7. Both versions are strictly 64 bit. Development for this version was strictly limited to Ubuntu (the base OS for Steam development). It has been tested to run on Ubuntu 12.04 and Ubuntu 15.10. On a Steam console it is automatically hardware-accelerated. It runs in Big Picture Mode and in Desktop Mode. Use either the mouse or controller in those environments. The Windows version has been tested on Windows 10 and Windows 7. This version of WeaponizedChess is more interested in the game being clearly displayable than in the game graphics being a spectacular example of computer animation. Those who are only interested in a game where the graphics are pure eye candy should play some other game. This game is about thinking. It is not about looking. This game is fun because you use your mind to see the pieces, to see all the possibilities. Chess has always been like that. The simple-geometric set of pieces will always be drawn quickly and clearly even if hardware acceleration is not available. The Steam overlay cannot be used in the Linux/SteamOS version. The overlay IS present and available in the Windows vesion. This game has been translated to many languages. The user can change the language displayed during game usage and read documentation in many languages. The game can be controlled using: English, German, Spanish, Dutch, French, Greek, Bulgarian, Turkish, Swedish, Norwegian, Finnish, Danish, Polish, Korean, Simplified Chinese, Traditional Chinese, Russian, Ukrainian, Hungarian, Czech, Romanian, Italian, Thai, Portuguese. To change the display language (the language in which the commands are printed and which you read while playing the game) to English, click File-&gt;Change To Which Language. Then select English. To make this change permanent so that the game always boots to English, first click Play Change-&gt;Save Present Settings as User Preferences. This causes any changes you have made (including the change you just made to English) to be the new User Preferences. Second, click Play Change-&gt;Toggle At Start Use User-Preferences/Game-Defaults. Assuming you had not already set this toggle to user preferences, this will now cause the game to boot (whenever you DO boot) to your user preferences (and display commands in English). WeaponizedChess does not use, rely, depend on or care about your present locale. You don't have to have locales set up on your Linux, you do not need your locale already set to your preferred language.",0,0.0,0,2711,0,True,2016

Explore the scene, unlock the story's branch points and unravel the mystery. There's also an explosion. Quanero was created with Unreal Engine 4 and can be downloaded for free. Background Information The possibility of experiencing stories in virtual reality offers completely new challenges to the art of storytelling. The traditional work of directing and the function of the cameraman have to be reconsidered completely, as the player is able to choose his point of view and position. We have tackled this challenge in our final bachelor project Quanero and even went one step further: in this experience, we also give the player complete control over the time. Thus, it is possible to move forward and backwards in time, to stop it or to view the action in slowmotion from every perspective in the room. We're offering the player a new and extremely immersive experience. The goal of the experience is to find the source of the devastating chain reaction which climaxes in an explosion. Quanero was developed specifically for HTC Vive. VR technology enables you to feel like you're in this futuristic bar, partaking in a brawl or a drug deal and finding yourself in a spectacular explosion with debris raining down on you.

Lightening fast reflexes won't win the game but well placed buildings and well chosen upgrades just might do the trick! Build your economy, spread your control and then... smash the crud out of you opponent! Fracture the Flag is a PvP oriented RTS, but has a growing single player set of features. The primary goal is to expand your territory and conquer your opponent's. Do this by planting flags to add to your area of control or taking out an opponents flag and erasing their influence, not to mention their buildings. Some territory is rich in resources other has tactical and strategic value. Or you could just peacefully use the nearby trees for target practice... Can't promise that's a winning strategy, but all to their own! Use siege weapons and hand delivered bombs to destroy opponents walls, flags, and maybe most importantly their economy. Stop a player's economy and you've got them by the tender bits. A Few More Details Each battle starts with a clean slate. All units, structures and weapons can be upgraded from a base level giving no in game advantage to more experienced players - other than of course their personal experience. The early part of each game will be based around resource collection in order to build more weapons, add more workers and plant flags to expand. Resources are also used to upgrade effectiveness of all in game units. Siege weapons will become more accurate and more powerful with upgrades allowing longer range bombardments. Workers will move faster allowing quicker bomb delivery and faster resource collection. Upgrade also also access to more buildings and military units. As players' territory expands the conflict will begin... Flags? What's the Deal? Flags are the mechanism by which a player controls land. A player may only build and place units within territory that they currently control. Need to add a mine? Better plant a flag. Want to be able to place siege weapons on top of a hill? Better plant a flag! Need another upgrade faster? Yeah, you better plant another flag. If a flag is destroyed any buildings left without a flag nearby will burn to the ground. Flags can be destroyed by bombs or by siege weapons. Workers Workers take on many roles. There are no specialized NPCs. The worker that loads the catapults will just as happily deliver a bomb to the gates of you foe or gather lumber from the local forest. Each role is largely based around one or more buildings. Buildings: Warehouse - the Center and Hub Of the Economy Construction Yard - Builds Siege Weapons Ammo Depot - stores Supplies For Siege Weapons Bomb Depot - Creates and store Bombs Lumber Mill - processes collected trees into usable wood Mine - supplies minerals Quarry - supplies stone Fire trap - explosive defense Plague trap - slow acting but long last defense Multiplayer Players will be able to use a matchmaking service to connect with other players around the world - a broadband connection is required for multiplayer.

Your storm scythe cuts exactly seven heads, but it makes ten heads grow back if the hydra is not dead. Is it possible to kill the hydra? What if you also had a silver dagger, which cuts just one head, but makes five heads grow back? Solution: It is impossible without the silver dagger (the number of heads always stays divisible by 3), but possible with the silver dagger, for example: 9 -&gt; longsword -&gt; 6 -&gt; longsword -&gt; 3 -&gt; dagger -&gt; 7 -&gt; scythe -&gt; 0.

While the early levels could be used to teach arithmetics and tactical planning in a fun way, building an effective set of weapons for late levels is a challenge even for expert number theorists! Hydra Slayer currently features a tutorial, 5 player character races with distinct characteristics, 28 enemy types (10 common hydras, each in two varieties, and 8 special enemies), 28 types of equipment including rare artifact weapons with special properties (not counting material and size variations), 15 weapon materials, 18 types of magical items which help you in your quests, three game geometries to choose from, 8 level topologies on very deep levels (including the Möbius strip and Klein bottle), 11 level generators, and two endings (a small victory for quick challenges and more casual players, and a big victory for those who want more challenge).

But the situation only gets worse when LABO’s nuclear reactor melts down, sending the facility into lockdown–with members of Sirius and survivors still trapped inside. With lethal radiation leaking everywhere and not enough anti-radiation medication to last until lockdown lifts, the survivors make more and more grim discoveries. In their struggle for survival, in a deathtrap full of fire and radiation, they learn that doubt is their greatest enemy, and trust their greatest asset.

Explore your very own planet, and eventually help conquer or help build up the planets of others. What is Metaverse? Metaverse is a voxel based action/adventure (Sci-Fi!) game about digging, discovering, designing, deploying, and defending. But we see it as more than a game. Metaverse is an ever-evolving platform, shaped by the actions of its players. Right now that involves players giving feedback about the direction of development. Before long, players will have a much more direct role in how Metaverse shapes up by traveling to the planets of other players and by trading and selling their fabrications. Fabrications are custom objects that can be created in-game by players, using the materials harvested from their planet. See below for more details. What can I do in Metaverse right now? Story Metaverse has what we believe to be an awesome storyline. Of course, we would say that! So we’ll let you be the judge. Tell us what you think so we can make improvements, create story branches, or even change its entire direction. We’re excited to build this thing with you! We’ve built out the first chapter of the story in the form of a tutorial. If you rush through and don’t stop to smell the roses or explore, there’s about 25-30 minutes of playable story in the game right now. Sandbox Mode After the tutorial, you’re dropped straight into sandbox mode. In this mode, you can explore your planet. This is also where you can dig and create (though a major component of creating is also found in Metaverse’s Fabricator). Because of the technical challenges involved with setting up procedural terrains otherwise, most voxel based games offer only either completely cubed geometry or completely rounded geometry. Metaverse, being a simulation from the future, has cracked the code, and is able to beautifully combine the two in a way that makes logical sense! The procedurally generated planet that currently ships with Metaverse is 300 Km in diameter, which is indeed very big. For now, let’s just call it, “New Texas.” If you were to run in a straight line without stopping, we estimate it would take you about 28 hours to completely circle the planet. Metaverse does not have biomes right now, but that is a planned feature, and we’ve already done a lot of the development work needed to support that. You tell us what’s most important to you, and that’s where we’ll focus development! Fabricator In the Fabricator, you can process the raw resources you’ve collected from your planet into refined materials. Using these refined materials in the Simulation mode of the Fabricator, you can create just about anything you want. And as long as you’ve got enough refined resources for the elements you’ve used, you can fabricate it into an actual object that can be taken outside to your planet and deployed. Elements in the fabricator are based on real periodic table elements, and have accurate densities. So if you make the walls of your base out of titanium, they're going to be significantly stronger than if you had made them with clay. What are the limitations right now? Metaverse is Early Access, so there will be bugs. We’re working hard to sort these out, and with your help, will stomp out the ones that are most important to you as quickly as possible. And if you find something lacking, we want to hear about it! Is Metaverse under active development? Yes, very much so! Metaverse is now a full time project, not an on-the-nights-and-weekends project! I have an idea for Metaverse! Great! We want to hear it! Please head over to the Metaverse discussion forums and let your voice be heard. Metaverse is a game meant to be directed by its community. That’s why we’re releasing as Early Access, after all! I found a bug! Great! Please do us a favor and send an email to support@jointhemetaverse.com . That will get your bug into our help desk software and allow you to track its status as we work to fix it. Metaverse exists to be the exemplification of the democratization of knowledge and thereby the dissemination of power, primarily through the novel exploitation of computation through collaboration within simulation.",79,1579.2099999999998,-11,2826,0,True,2016

Cubotrox is an addictive puzzle game that challenges you to complete pixel art images by managing falling neon-colored cubes. Catch, drop and rotate your way to victory in a game with retro-futuristic neon visuals and synth-retro-wave music that excels at being “easy to play, hard to master”. EASY MECHANICS THAT ADD UP TO KILLER MIND-BREAKING CHALLENGES The game can be summed up in a real easy way: you have pixel art images that must be completed by managing some neon-colored cubes that are constantly appearing from all sides of the screen. You must manage these cubes to complete the image. Mechanics are rather simple: catch, drop and rotate the cubes and rotate all the screen. But as you progress you start to face increasing challenges related to the limited time, the management of the cubes, the frequency of the cubes’ fall, etc. But there’s no use on explaining this: go play the game. By minute 1 you will say “hehe, this is stupidly simple”; but by minute 20 you will be fully engaged and screaming “damn! I didn’t think of that! Let’s re-start this level AGAIN!”. Believe us: you will end admitting that Cubotrox is a masterclass on “easy to play, hard to master”. A BEAUTIFUL ENDLESS STREAM OF PIXEL ART Cubotrox’ puzzles are comprised by pixel art images that must be completed through cube management. Don’t fool ourselves: there’s an ongoing pixel art craze and we’re not trying to fight against it.

Damn, see the our video: it is just little cubes being rotated and dropped at seemingly simple pixel-art images. We know. All people start by being a bit skeptical with Cubotrox because of its perceived simplicity but almost all those people ends addicted to it once they start playing the game. Because Cubotrox isn’t something that you can explain in a text or even through a video: Cubotrox is a feeling you get once you start playing, when the increasing difficult challenges are mixed with the retro-futuristic neon visuals and the synth-retro-wave music. It’s a great feeling that slowly secludes you in the hypnotic world of Cubotrox. So, please, stop reading this and just start playing: you will see we’re all about game feel.

As postmaster of the USS West Virginia, Downing gave himself the task of writing letters to the families of men who died or were injured during the attack; those letters form an arc that the user follows through Downing’s experience of Dec. 7, 1941.

Throughout the experience, users interact with realistic virtual versions of artifacts from the time, along with iconic photography and archival video, providing a unique and personal view of one of American history’s defining moments. This experience was created in collaboration with the WWII Museum and the Library of Congress who provided expertise, artifacts, and primary sources; and with award-winning historian Craig Nelson as historical advisor.

Don’t follow several and odd sophistical doctrines that spread pestiferous seeds – wrote Clement VI himself in the year 1346 to the masters and alumni from Paris University. The Pontifex addressed in his letters to the doctrine of an illustrious Franciscan monk of English origin named William of Occam, who ran away several years earlier from the prison of Avignon, accused of heresy. He had been imprisoned for four years, until he could escape, and shought asylum in the court of Emperor Ludwig of Bavaria, who was at odds with Pope John XXII. When the Emperor died, William wanted to return to the mission with his order and the church, so he traveled to Italy with his young novice to meet Bernardo Gui, who was the head of the Inquisition at that time in that region, and, ultimately, the representative of the Pope. However we cannot know for certain whether William achieved his goal. Only the testimony left by his disciple years after the events happened, in a collection of scrolls; where those amazing and terrible events that happened during the week William and him spent in the abbey the meeting was scheduled were described.

With a cast of crazed characters, simple but beautifully difficult gameplay, and a pulsing musical score, Atomik is a loud, trippy mess of twitchy platforming goodness. The two-button setup is treacherously simple. One button shoots your massive gun downwards, propelling you through the air. The other shoots forward, destroying anything that’s in your path. But there is no stopping in this beautifully surreal world littered with deadly traps and soul-crushing obstacles around every corner. Players will have to constantly alternate between the two firing modes to maneuver through meticulously crafted levels where death is a promise not a possibility. There is only running, gunning, jumping, and gunning, in a mad dash to survive long enough to die again. The game takes place in the Extax System , a solar system where the Sun has begun to swell and devour planets. With most of the planets already devoured, the remaining worlds have descended into madness and superstition. Each denizen has their own theory on why the sun seems so enraged, but they all hang on one central element: Atomiks , the primary resource in the entire system. You play as a scavenger, a rogue from outside the Extax System who seems to have only one goal: get Atomiks. What do the Atomiks mean to the scavenger? Does he want to scoop up precious resources for himself, or use them as a way to appease the sun and end the suffering of the system? Or Maybe they’re just shiny pick-ups in a video game to him. Beautifully Difficult: Every second counts, and the game will test your reflexes to the fullest Shield Mode: Empower your intergalactic scavenger with an energy shield and decreases the movement speed to help make the intense action more manageable, but no less heart pounding and exciting. Nonstop Action: Merciful respawns let you die fast and keep you constantly in the action Two button gameplay: One button lets you fly, the other blasts obstacles into heaps of rubble. Three Unique Game Worlds: Each world presents its own distinct challenges which require players to change their playstyles Over 120 levels of Mayhem: Each level is meticulously crafted to hone and test the player’s speed and tenacity. Marathon Mode: For players looking to compete for the global high score. Surreal visuals: Trippy and hyper-colourful fantasy-sci-fi art style Hyperkinetic soundtrack: Pulsing musical score blending hip hop, electronic and movie-score vibes. Warped space-opera narrative: The game features a cast of crazed, beautifully illustrated characters. Masochistic Collectables: The quest to collect “Atomiks” littered throughout levels lends an extra level of insanity to already merciless level design. A gift to self-hating completionists. Accessible single-hand gameplay: Appropriate for players with disabilities. Made by free range developers fed a pure mixture of VVVVVV, Hotline Miami, and Super Meat Boy.",286,2285.14,218,2678,21,True,2016

You manage a tribe of hunter-gatherers, helping them survive and thrive in a savage world. As you become more prosperous, rival tribes will take notice. At first they will judge you based on appearances, but you can change their opinion based on the actions you take. Simulated Natural Environment The natural environment is heavily simulated. Water flow, ground saturation, evaporation, fertility, temperature and humidity all contribute to shaping world. Cut down all the trees and eventually they will stop regrowing. Use up all the water in a pond and it will be dry until the rains return. Day/Night and Seasonal cycle Temperature and humidity are affected by the time of day and season. Winters can be harsh with below-freezing temperatures, so keep the camp fires going to prevent hypothermia. The Circle of Life Plants and animals adhere to the circle of life. Plants absorb organics from the soil as they grow, produce fruit during maturity and return organics upon death. Animals travel in herds around the map trying to fulfill their own needs. For predators, this means hunting other animals when hungry. For prey, this means running away from anything that views them as dinner. Nature is the Ultimate Provider Almost everything you need will come from nature. Plants are harvested for their produce, animal carcasses are butchered for materials and rocks are broken down to make tools. Procedural World Each time you start a new game, the world is procedurally generated. You can select which biome you want to embark on, which will affect yearly temperature and rainfall patterns, animals and plant species, and the ground layers that make up the world. Craft the Tools of Survival Craft spears to defend against wildlife and other tribes, axes to cut down trees and awls to make clothing. Some tools are even capable of performing several tasks. The stone knife speeds up fire creation, but can also be used as a weapon in a pinch. Stop the Decay Food left in the open decays very quickly. Build pits to slow down this process. Don't place it too close to camp, or the warmth from a campfire will speed up decay. If the pit gets wet, any food inside won't last very long either. It's all part of the deep simulation that drives Tribe Of Pok. Build Monuments Guide your tribe to prosperity by building monuments of the Stone Age. Arrange individual stones however you like, we provide the pieces for your designs! Take Charge in Combat When danger approaches, quickly take control of Pokian Warriors in Combat Mode to deal with the threat. In Combat Mode, you can select and order Pokians around just like in a real time strategy game. Diplomacy &amp; Discovery A unique diplomacy system where foreign tribes will initially judge you based on appearances.

Want to know more? Here’s a closer look at what you can do with Quicken WillMaker Plus: Your Will The heart of every estate plan is a will, also known as a last will and testament. This legal document puts you in control of who inherits your property and who would take care of your children if it were ever necessary. Without a will, state law determines these issues. Your will also allows you to name an executor (sometimes called a “personal representative”) to carry out our wishes. And you can appoint a trusted person to manage property left to young people. With Quicken WillMaker Plus, you can revise and update your will whenever you like. New for 2016: You can now use Quicken WillMaker Plus to give your executor authority over your digital assets, including social media accounts, online banking and more. Your Health Care Directive Spare your loved ones difficult decisions by laying out your wishes for medical care and naming someone to carry out your instructions: Health Care Power of Attorney Name a trusted person (your 'health care agent') to make important medical decisions for you if necessary. Living Will State what types of medical treatment you do or do not want if you are too ill or injured to direct your own care. Your health care providers must do all they can to follow your wishes. Your Durable Power of Attorney for Finances A durable power of attorney ensures that someone you trust (called your 'agent' or 'attorney-in-fact') will be on hand to manage the many practical, financial tasks that will arise if you become incapacitated. For example, bills must be paid, bank deposits must be made and someone must handle insurance and benefits paperwork. In most cases, a durable power of attorney for finances is the best way to take care of tasks like these. New for 2016: You can now use the Quicken WillMaker Plus to give your attorney-in-fact authority over your digital assets. Your Final Arrangements Plan a funeral or other ceremony and ease the burden on your loved ones. Describe your preferences for burial, cremation, memorials, obituaries and more. Documents for Your Executor Make sure your executor has all the forms and instructions necessary to do the job: checklists, letters, notices and claim forms. Information for Caregivers and Survivors Organize your information so that your survivors don't have to. Use these documents to give them details about everything from bank accounts, to passwords, to the names of people you'd like contacted in the event of your illness or death. Letter to Survivors Use the Letter to Survivors to leave your loved ones detailed explanations about your decisions. For example, you may want to let them know why you made certain gifts or named a particular person to be your executor. You can also use your letter to leave some general thoughts about your life. Personal Finance Documents Over a dozen forms let you handle common financial situations, such as lending or borrowing money between friends or family, creating a bill of sale, and closing a credit card account. Home &amp; Family Documents Practical forms you can use every day to help run your home and keep your family safe, including authorizations and agreements, promissory notes, limited powers of attorney, and child and elder care forms.",1,0.0,1,2901,0,True,2016

It features an inclusive, politically aware story, with narrative beats about community, identity and activism. It has pretty pixel art and moody music. And it was made by Analgesic studios, the two-person team behind one of my favorite titles of 2013, Anodyne, a beautiful, pointed take on 2D Zelda-style games. That was always going to speak to me. But what I found in Even the Ocean surprised me even further: It's not just a good game, but a milestone for a sensitive, thoughtful studio working in an uncertain and often downright scary world.' - Danielle Riendeau for Waypoint 'Perhaps even more intriguing, though, is how this energy system affects the logic and culture of Even the Ocean‘s world. It makes sense that the tallest city, Whitforge City, and its celestial spire runs on Light energy. Given that it relies on the power plants that Aliph restores to keep running, the city and its Light energy also come to represent industrialism and science.' - Chris Priestman for Killscreen 'Even the Ocean is a shining example of how we should be treating diversity and accessibility in games paired with interesting plaforming challenges.' - Affinity Archives Steam Curator ~ Youtube Gameplay Footage Even The Ocean (1): Super Accessible, Chill Narrative Platformer by Sir TapTap Smash Look! - Even The Ocean Gameplay by Smash GaminG!! - Frazzz -- Content Warnings (No Spoilers) Environmental Doom/Catastrophe, Workplace Deaths, Bigotry towards LGBTQ+ people and POC, mild body horror Content Warnings (Spoilers) Bigotry towards LGBTQ+ people and POC - some of the NPCs in Whiteforge say bigoted things to the player/other characters Workplace Deaths (Early on, a character is electrocuted and dies (no gore or graphic violence though).

In Japan, the ruling Shogun family has lost its grip on the country. A civil war is brewing as regional lords actively expand their influence. In Korea, the Joseon dynasty is paralysed by factional struggle within the royal court. In China, the might of the Ming dynasty is waning due to rebellions and foreign incursions.

Other armies from East Asia are also made available to simulate different conflicts across the region. Take command of diverse armies which employ varying tactical doctrines.

Become more ambitious and achieve regional domination through the operational campaign layer where you have to deal with the consequence of preceding battles. To become the Japanese Shogun, to overthrow the Emperor of the Middle Kingdom, or to establish a Pan-Asian Empire, one requires mastery of the battlefield.

35569,Corpse Party,2016-04-25,14.99,131,GrisGris,"XSEED Games,Marvelous USA, Inc.","Adventure,Indie,RPG","Kisaragi Academy student Mayu Suzumoto is transferring to a new high school, leaving behind a sizable group of friends and countless lovely memories. To help her cope with this move, her friend Ayumi has devised a seemingly innocent plan: the whole group will come together to perform a charm she found on the internet called “Sachiko Ever After,” which is supposed to bind all of its participants together as friends to the end. This does not go as expected. Following an intense earthquake, the group awakens to find themselves separated and trapped in an alternate reality version of Heavenly Host Elementary, a tragedy-stricken institution that once stood on the site of their own school but was torn down long ago. Here, the vengeful spirits of elementary-aged children threaten their lives and their sanity, and the only hope of escape – much less survival – is to uncover the chilling details surrounding the murders of those trapped before them. Corpse Party is the original Windows edition of the cult classic horror game that gained a considerable fanbase when released on Sony’s PlayStation®Portable system in 2011. Beginning life as an independent RPG Maker adventure title in 1996, the gameplay was greatly refined and the story greatly expanded for this 2008 remake, featuring more characters, more detailed interactions, darker story elements, over 5,000 lines of voice-acting and dozens of shocking, gruesome endings. Players take control of nine main characters and several side characters who’ve been split up into groups of two or three and trapped in a run-down, otherworldly elementary school full of vengeful spirits, deadly mysteries and – of course – corpses. As they walk around examining objects and bodies in an atmospheric 2D environment, a horror tale spanning over 50 years begins to unfold, and player choices determine both how the story ends and who lives to see it through. KEY FEATURES Highly Detailed Retro-Style Graphics Used to Enhance Atmosphere Modeled after the very first RPG Maker Corpse Party , the game’s 16-bit-style 2D visuals help create an intentional disconnect that sparks the imagination, leading the player to envision far worse things than even the most powerful next-gen system could display. Adventure-Style Gameplay Where Your Decisions Make All the Difference Playing like a cross between a point-and-click adventure game and a classic JRPG sans battles, Corpse Party gives players the freedom to thoroughly explore every last corner of Heavenly Host Elementary School, significantly altering the course of the story and its final conclusion based on where the characters go and what they do. Chapter-Based Storytelling with PC-Exclusive Content The tale is told through five main chapters with multiple endings each and numerous scenes that differ from the game’s PSP™ system and Nintendo 3DS™ system counterparts. In addition, there are four bonus chapters, one of which is a PC-exclusive retelling of the “Tooth” story from Corpse Party: Book of Shadows , recreated with added content in classic Corpse Party adventure style. Original Japanese Voice Cast and Character Art plus Text Skip Feature Over 5,000 lines of spoken Japanese dialogue from the original indie voice cast complement the action, giving new spins on familiar characters for series veterans. In addition, the original PC-exclusive character art is fully intact, and dedicated players seeking every ending are given a speedy fast-forward function to make replays a breeze. The Game That Started It All When first released in 2008, this title sparked a Corpse Party boom in Japan: remakes, sequels, spin-offs, fan games, manga, anime, a live-action drama series and more, as well as countless Corpse Party -inspired horror games created by other indie developers in the same style.

Creatures have DNA that defines their structure, traits, how they see the world around them, and how they react to it. Each creature is unique, most die quickly, some die a little slower, and others survive (some just like rocks, they usually die too). It is the survivors that reproduce and mutate, just a little, but enough to adapt to their environment. Early creatures are pretty basic but they have the capacity for some pretty elaborate behaviors and, to be honest, I am not sure how interesting this could get. There are a number of games built around this evolution simulator. Primordial Soup is a free for all evolution platform where the creatures evolve mostly independently. You can help them along but its their world and they do what they like. To start you choose a world (or create a new one) and all the creatures become part of a global shared pool. It quickly becomes apparent that older more evolved creatures will dominate but there is always a chance you could evolve one that survives. Alternatively you can just start a new world and become the dominant creature there. In Tidepool, the world is stacked in your favor to help you select and breed the creatures you deem fit to live. At first you control a small handful of creatures and help them find food, focus on those that move independently, or just let them figure it out. You compete against creatures that evolved in other tide pools from other players so it is never the same game twice. If you do manage to take over the environment all your creatures level up and you start over competing against the next level of enemy creatures. The laboratory is where you can experiment on your creatures, cross breed creatures with other creatures, manage, save and share your creatures, and apply targeted mutations. Unfortunately the laboratory was not secure enough and the inevitable outbreak occurred.

Use Archery and Magic to defeat hostile armies in this Adventure and Defense hybrid. Gameplay is challenging and the world is filled with secrets to discover. Skill and intuition are a must if you expect to stand in the way of the invading forces. The bow and arrow mechanics are far more involved than your average archery shooter - it's up to you to keep your quivers re-stocked, and to learn advantageous techniques like speed-loading, enchanting, as well as plenty of unadvertised tricks that I hope you get the pleasure of discovering yourself. Adventure mode often takes you outside the castle walls and presents unique battle situations, puzzles and challenges. Each episode introduces something new and these encounters also unlock minigame modes for you to enjoy even more replay-ability. While following this story driven mode you'll be fighting in large battles, boss fights, exploring the castles secrets, and thinking your way out of predicaments. Still heavily in development, Chapter 1 Episode 1 &amp; 2 are available now, and a preview to Chapter 2 is also provided during early access. In Endless mode, the goblin army mounts their attacks in progressively more difficult waves. There is time inbetween each wave for you to explore the interior of the castle to resupply, solve puzzles and explore. Items found within the castle may differ slightly each time you play, and are useful for granting new spells and abilities. The enemies have lots of tricks to throw at you, from simple grunts to sharpshooters and battering rams the further you get the crazier things will be. If you die, the game is over. If the castle gate is breached - you will fall back inside the castle to protect the throne until your inevitable defeat (see also 'Last Stand' under Minigames) Endless mode has a global leaderboard, can you make the top 10? Defense of Castle Chilly contains several minigames which allow you to earn highscores and experience new ways to enjoy specific aspects of the game. More minigames will be added as the game develops during Early Access. Last Stand This minigame allows you to skip the rest of the gameplay of Endless mode and go straight to a variation of the throne room scenario (this is when the castle has been breached, and it is your duty to protect the throne until your last breath). In 'Last Stand' there is no rest, and nowhere to run, just you standing between the throne and the invading forces. Kill as many as you can, survive as long as possible! You will be quickly swarmed and overrun by goblins, it will get your heart racing! Deer Hunt This minigame gives you a break from the intense battles to do some simple hunting in the forest (where nothing is trying to kill you for a change). This game is a test of accuracy and patience. You start with 15 arrows, and will be awarded more if your accuracy is good enough. Your final score will be total game kills. Take your time, make the shot! PC Overlord A special mode for Local Versus, read more in the 'Local Versus' section below You can have a buddy help you out with the keyboard/mouse or gamepad. The second player joins in as a small flying Fairy, capable of shooting magic bolts and casting spells designed specifically for assistance (The Fairy is a support character). Local Co-Op can be used on majority of game modes and any play style (ie: Endless/Last Stand/Campaign), just press 'A' on your gamepad or 'Ctrl' on the keyboard to tag in as the Fairy.

As the VR player, your skill and wits will be challenged by your opponents birds-eye control of the battlefield and unique abilities. An online guide is available for tips on how to use the Overlord: -pc-overlord Sometimes, as part of the adventure mode, you'll need to solve puzzles to progress. It isn't all about the combat, while you're catching your breathe, you'll be using your mind. Puzzles within Castle Chilly are not complex, but they aren't always obvious either, there are usually no prompts to hold your hand, it's up to you to notice that something's a'miss, and let your natural curiousity take over. Most puzzles are physically based, expecting you to think like you're physically there (rather than think like you're playing a game). Endless mode will also have you discovering mystical rooms and unlocking the castles secrets and puzzles along the way. Castle Chilly is designed to make full use of VR, this is a 100% room-scale walking experience, no 'blink' style teleportation or any other 'locomotion'. Instead, magic doorways, staircases, elevators and moving platforms are your passage to other rooms and areas, you'll be walking in circles and back and forth in the real world, but exploring a vast castle and battlefield in the virtual world. In other words, you traverse this world using your own two feet. The environment adapts to your available room space, ensuring your virtual world space closely matches your real world space. (Your rooms in Castle Chilly may differ slightly to your friends, if your play sizes differ). Play Styles Arcade Mode Recommended for new players - you have only a back quiver, and your arrows are unlimited (no reloading!), this style is much more consistent to other archery games and allows you to focus on the action. Classic Mode Take full advantage of the advanced archery techniques this game has to offer. You have a Hip &amp; Back quiver and must properly manage your supply of arrows. This allows for cool techniques like speed-shooting and spell stacking, and also means improved arrows can be found and used. However, this play style is difficult to master. This game also has several secret techniques and secret spells that I hope you get the pleasure of discovering through your own experimentation.

Shoppe Keep challenges you to shrewdly set the price of each item and watch the money roll in – but if your stock is too expensive, you will find your supplies shrinking as stealing increases! Stop Thieves quickly, with a swing of your sword or a zap of a lightning spell! (Or maybe both, if you’re really bloodthirsty.) Price your wares competitively and great adventurers will travel from miles away to your one-stop shop to spend their gold – the gold that they probably found conveniently placed on a cave floor! Shoppe Keep delivers deep gameplay mechanics in a memorable, tongue-in-cheek world. Gone are the days of testing the theoretical water – we’re now a fully-fledged, fully-opened store! We even have an inn! This building has been blocked off for some time, and many have speculated that it will be an Inn – well, the sneaky players were right! The Inn is best used at lower levels and a lower gold count. For a small amount of kPoints, you are able to unlock the Inn with a single table for four guests. An inn with a single table? What complete rubbish! Additional tables can be purchased by speaking with the innkeeper, as well as additional upgrades that will help your Inn deliver serious coin. Adventurers traveling through town might want to visit the Inn and enjoy some food and ale – if they haven’t found some randomly laying around on their travels already. We all know that fantasy worlds cater for their heroes – but with Shoppe Keep, you’ll be able to make sure that catering doesn’t equal ‘potato in a toilet’! Various members of four completely original and never before seen character classes will visit your store, including hardened warriors, magical mages, sneaky rogues and wise druids. (As you can tell, we’re taking this description text VERY seriously!) Each of these character types will seek to purchase items relating to their unique skill set - a warrior will be hard-pressed to take a flimsy magical robe into close quarters’ battle, for instance! Mages, however, will be perfectly happy with a wooden stick. It’s ‘magical’, or something ridiculous those absurd mages believe. Will you be able to accommodate for all four classes of customers? You have a completely unreasonable clientele to add pressure to your role as a Shoppe Keeper. After a day of heroism, beating up goblins and even battling the great ol’ Dragonclaw, your customers can be just a little short-fused. This means your displays can be spoilt and your tables may be damaged by angry customers! The renegade ‘heroes’ are not too worried about bringing in dirt from the street either! However, help is at hand! As the owner of the store you’ll be armed with various exciting tools for combating these issues. The mighty wooden broomstick will sweep away dirt brought in from your customers, and the great hammer will repair furniture damaged by these ‘extraordinary’ visitors. A few sweeps and a couple of swings means that your shop will be in tip-top shape. Grow your business, and you can employ an army of ‘Helper Bots’ to take care of this for you – the cutting edge in imaginary technology that totally exists. Set your prices too high and your customers may think twice about investing their hard won (or stolen) gold in your shop. They’ll take the plunge and attempt to steal stock right under your nose! With no CCTV available in ye olde world of Shoppe Keep, you have to rely on your combat skill! A sharp swing of the sword or the zap of a magic spell can make quick work of these pesky Thieves. But be cautious not to hit any innocent bystanders or you’ll suffer a monetary penalty, as well as a life riddled with guilt! Not to mention the hideous moral conundrum of whether or not to tell your family or- look, just don’t kill innocent people. And let’s not forget the ferocious Barbarians! They live on the outskirts of the city, looming like an ancient race of organic-synthetic hybrids that invade the gal- wait, wrong game. Regularly invading the town, Barbarians will cause as much damage and destruction as possible! They will even fight you directly if you try to stop them. Eliminate a few dozen Barbarians and they’ll invite a much… larger friend to come and visit you. But what will you do with all the bodies? Unless you wish to display the corpses as examples to your customers, you monster, you’ll need to use either the broomstick or the grinder. It’s tough running a shop (especially one that may or may not be the venue of a murder-fest); there are not enough hours in the day to go out and procure new items for yourself. Thankfully, you can employ a Champion, unlocked via the skill tree. Select a class, equip the Champion with your finest armour and weapons, and send them out to bring home rare new wares. Despite that awful half-rhyme, some of these items can be sold, some are junk and others can be crafted into more powerful gear. Your Champion will need to gain experience, just like the fantasy heroes you’re familiar with. During their first outing, they may fall in battle (and regret not saving more recently!), and whilst they will not return with any new goods, the experience will have taught them valuable skills that will improve their chances next time. ‘Helper Bots’ are your robotic staff team. The MK III charts the latest iteration of this tech, increasing the artificial intelligence of this mechanical chap. We all knew that true AI technology would be created before CCTV – it was inevitable. The ‘Helper Bot’ has three duties; zapping Thieves who attempt to steal from your shop, picking up items that customers may have thrown to the floor, and restocking items back on the shelves. You can purchase several ‘Helper Bots’ to, well, help run your shop. Make a living for yourself in a tongue-in-cheek fantasy world FEATURES Make a living for yourself in a tongue-in-cheek fantasy world Manage your own Shoppe, from ordering stock to setting prices Design your own Shoppe layout by ordering tables, shelves and weapon racks The world of Shoppe Keep reacts to your every Shoppe decision, including prices and stock quality Unlock new abilities and perks in the skill menu, including alchemy, harvesting, and the capability to own a grinder and a high tier stock.
