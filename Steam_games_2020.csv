I believe demos are great for people to try out an experience and see if it resonates with them without committing to a price point. Why I made this Over the past 9 months, I created Shivering Hearts by myself with RPG Maker MV in my free time to show my artistic skills. I also wanted to create something that brings back the magic that I sorely miss from old school 1990s PC RPGs like Baldur's Gate 2, Fallout 1, 2, and Planescape; Torment. CLANNAD, Undertale, LISA: the Painful RPG, and Oneshot were also huge influences. Role Playing Games can be so much more than combat, stats, character builds and optimal play (however, I still value these game design aspects very, very much). I wanted to challenge myself to see if I can still create an engaging experience that doesn't have combat or leveling mechanics, within a 1 month period. That turned into 10 months. I wanted to make a game with deep conversation trees, memorable characters and an emotionally touching story. RPG Maker MV allowed me to create and bug-test very intricate dialogue trees that match the quality and scale of those older titles but at the fraction of the development time and with plenty of polish. I hope that I have done those games justice.",16,127.84,14,1258,0,True,2020

Music Wave is a challanging Rhythm game for Electronic Dance Music that uses the home row of the keyboard. Players can create, share and download custom tracks through use of third party tools. With a modern skin and beautiful effects, each song will captivate your senses. Gameplay Ranging from difficult to easy, players can play through various EDM songs using ten keys from the home row of the keyboard. Through pressing notes as they traverse across the activation area, players accumulate score. Missing a note or pressing the wrong key losses life whereas hitting notes in succession heals the player. Score is accumulated from both streak and precision. Hitting notes in a row builds streak which applies to the base note value. Base note values are determined by the accuracy of the press. There are three tiers of accuracy. Players must master both precision and consistency to score high. Custom Songs Players can easily create, share, and download custom songs through use of third party tools. This means any song can be turned into a MusicWave track. Songs are generated from midis allowing players to use their favorite midi editing software to create tracks. For more information on creating songs, see the game website. Career Mode There are plans for a career mode, or standard set of songs that grow in difficulty.

Under the northern stars, the young man who has lost everything when his dream crashed, is now all alone in a forest dark and snow-covered.

3000,WordTactics,2020-12-31,3.99,0,Cory Forrest Cohen,Crigarn Studios,"Indie,Strategy","WordTactics is a single-player strategic word puzzle game. You place letter tiles in a grid, then select adjacent letters to form words and score points. WordTactics is more strategic than most word puzzle games because it requires players to think critically to obtain the highest scores. If you enjoy word puzzles that are challenging and require more thought than simply hunting for words, you should try WordTactics! Compete with your Steam friends to obtain the highest score, or try to beat your own high score. How To Play Up to six letters will appear in the input tray. The player must choose where to drop the letters in a grid, which causes a new random letter to be added to the input tray. Selecting adjacent letters in the grid that spell an English word allows the player to score points based on the letters used and the length of the word. After a certain number of letters have been successfully used in words, the player advances to the next level. In each new level, a new type of letter tile with special properties is introduced. These new tiles increase the word score or create new challenges such as destroying other tiles or filling the grid. When the grid is full, no more tiles may be placed, and the game is over. Strategy Elements WordTactics permits a wide variety of strategies to obtain higher scores. Complete words can be kept in the grid rather than scored so that additional letters can be used to construct longer words. Knowledge of letter and diagram frequencies is important for anticipating possible future words and choosing the optimal placement of letters in the grid when no words can be easily spelled. Careful attention to letter point values and special tile bonuses can determine the highest scoring words from several options. The use of destructive letter tiles to destroy difficult or impossible to use tiles can prolong gameplay during the later levels where word scores are often the highest. These strategies and many others ensure will ensure that WordTactics will continue to be challenging well after your first game. Competitive Repeatable Play Even though a single WordTactics game can be completed in an hour or two, there are many opportunities for repeatable play. WordTactics supports four game lengths, ranging from as little as half-an-hour to several hours per game. As with most strategic games, practice makes perfect, and your high scores will probably improve as you play repeatedly. There are high score leader boards for each game length, allowing you to compete with your friends to see who can achieve the highest score. Or you can play against yourself, trying to beat your prior best score. Dozens of achievements provide unique challenges for completing the game under specific constraints, creating even more reasons to play WordTactics many times, for many hours of enjoyable gameplay.",6,23.94,4,1095,68,True,2020

In 1960 when the state of Bombay split like an egg on the jagged edge of the Western Ghats and formed the territories of Gujarat and Maharashtra, the town of Matsyapura was abandoned by government decree - to make it easier to draw a clean border between the new states. Mir UmarHassan, the fabled Gujarati poet, lamented this willful and violent erasure of an ancient town and in a delightful satirical poem titled : The Building Eaters of Matsyapur, he wrote about the vapid consumption of a place and the creation of a populace that is devoid of the flavors of their individual and munificent past.

28196,Robo Gauntlet,2020-12-15,8.99,0,KodakYarr,Infernal Interactive,"Action,Indie,Simulation,Strategy,Early Access","Robo Gauntlet is a chaotic strategy game where you input programming cards into your robot's command-line registry at the same time as other players and then lean back and watch as the robots perform the actions and cause mayhem! Players assume control of one of many robots in a hazardous testing facility filled with moving conveyor belts, laser beams, bottomless pits, and a variety of other obstacles. There will be two game mode types; coop and versus. The goal in a game of versus is, apart from survival, to be the first to reach a predetermined number of checkpoints in the correct order. The real difficulty however is movement, which is accomplished with the randomly dealt programming cards. The goal in a game of coop is to work together to reach a common goal, be it collecting or moving something, finishing a specific task, eliminating the baddies, or even fighting a boss. The program cards specify movement, such as move one or more spaces forward, turn left or right, move back, or turn around. The cards have to be arranged by the player in the specific order they wish the cards to play out and the robot to move. Each player receives nine cards each turn. They use five of the cards to specify their robot's movement for the given turn, playing each card face down into one of five available 'command-line registries'. All robots move simultaneously, each player's robot performing each register in turn. Robot priority is resolved by where the robot closest to the transmitter goes first. A robot moving into an occupied space pushes the blocking robot, and any additional ones beyond that, into the next space providing that there is no wall or other immovable object in the way. When players' robots are damaged they receive virus and bug cards that dilute the draw pile. To get rid of these bugs the player needs to program the bug into a register to be able to discard it after played, effectively squashing the bug. Each player has a very limited amount of time to program their cards since as soon as the first player has programmed all five registries a timer is started. When the timer runs out the remaining players that haven't finished programming will get their unfinished programming scrambled. This combined with the unpredictability of the plans of the other players and the hazards of the facility often leads to one's robot moving in unexpected ways! Players also have the option to upgrade their robots with weapons and device upgrades, which add to the carnage and mayhem. These upgrades can cause additional damage, allow robots to move differently like breaking normal movement rules, affect the movement of other robots, and disrupt opponents' plans in other ways. The game realizes a reversal of the concept of computer simulation games: rather than computers simulating some real-world action, human players try to simulate the actions of a computer.",3,26.97,3,1111,0,True,2020

49739,VR Gigapixel Gallery,2020-07-01,0.0,0,"Gerald Terveen,Daniel Richter",Gigapixel GmbH,Education,"About this application The 'Gigapixel VR Gallery' is an opportunity to view extremely high-resolution pictures in various sizes exactly up close in 6DoF (images can be found on / ). The gallery has 48 motifs ranging from 136 megapixels to 15.9 gigapixels. One gigapixel is 1000 megapixels. There is also an option to switch between the high resolution with a resolution of 25 megapixels. This helps to understand what influence the distance to the image has for qualitative perception. The closer you are to the subject, the more important it is that the resolution is high enough. One square on the floor equals 1m². This project is more a matter of the heart than somehow making money professionally. VR Benchmark The VR Gigapixel Gallery enables you to compare different headsets in terms of perceptible resolution without the frame rate factor. Roughly 3 factors limit the visual perception of a headset: 1. Technical limit of VR glasses 2. Resolution of the image 3. Resolution of the eye. Since the size of the image can be individually adjusted, it is easy to reach the limit of the resolution of the eye. Of course, with today's technological level, this means that the resolution of VR glasses is the real limiting factor. If you want to perceive the resolution between different headsets in real situations, apart from the technical specifications, you have a good tool at hand for a subjective optical benchmark. NASA/ESA There are two images in the gallery, which were taken by the Hubble telescope (NASA/ESA). These images in the gallery are scientifically incorrect, because we have optimized them with aesthetic perception in mind and we also corrected certain image errors. ppi is not dpi The most common mistake is that ppi is equated with dpi. Pixels per inch (ppi) means that a rectangular pixel has a defined color. Dot per inch means that a printer assembles a dot from several micro-color dots in order to 'simulate' the color. It is also important that the substrate 'absorbs' the color and that the dot is still somewhat enlarged due to the 'bleeding'. The printer doesn't care what resolution the image has. A single pixel can be easily printed at 1440 dpi because the dpi only reflects the technical ability of the printer. In order to classify ppi and dpi: most prints can print information from 70-150ppi on carrier materials.

Diffraction counts as the often underestimated value. Camera manufacturers promise a huge resolution sensor, but this can only be used in very specific situations and is usually just a marketing idea. If we ignore all other influences (which additively worsen everything further), a full-frame camera (24x36mm) with an aperture of 8 only has the possibility to bring about 30 megapixels of information to the sensor due to diffraction. At aperture 11 it would be 15 megapixels and at aperture 16 it would only be 7.5 megapixels. Conversely, the resolution increases with a smaller f-number. At f / 5.6 it would be 60 megapixels, at f / 4 it would be 121 megapixels. You might think that everything is fine, when you use a maximum aperture of 5.6 with a 50 megapixel 35mm camera. There are two problems with this. The lesser problem nowadays is the optimal sharpness of the lens, since this is technically well solved, that it is reasonably homogeneous over a few aperture steps. The bigger problem is that the higher the resolution of the image, the lower the sharpness level, especially the closer the subject is. This means that if you are not close to the infinity focus of the lens, the focus level will be too small if you use a small f-number. This inevitably leads to focus stacking in order to achieve a greater depth of field, which in turn leads to other problems (keyword movement). Or you can just downsize the image. This as a small digression, why pictures often look bad, even though you think you have a sufficiently high-resolution camera. If you have any questions on this topic, we would be happy to help, just contact us. Here are a few approximate values for diffraction and sensor size at aperture 8: Compact camera 2/3 “(7x9mm): 2.2 megapixels MicroFourThirds (13x17mm): 8 megapixels APS-C (16x17mm): 13.5 megapixels Full frame (24x36mm): 30 megapixels Medium format small (30x45mm): 47 megapixels Medium format large (40x53mm): 76 megapixels The bottom line from this information is also that there is no commercially available camera, which at aperture 8 can create even one of the high-resolution images with a single image here, unless the currently known physics is turned upside down.",3,0.0,3,1278,0,True,2020

Back in 1994 we created one of the first examples of a new genre of arcade gaming: the trance shooter, with 'Tempest 2000' on the Atari Jaguar. Since then we have been creating software - both games and visualisers - with the specific intent to create in its users a euphoric experience, something that players will return to again and again simply because the act of playing feels so good. Memorable milestones along the way include the Virtual Light Machine lightsynths, the Xbox 360 music visualiser, and games such as Space Giraffe, Gridrunner Revolution, Polybius and the Minotaur Arcade games. In recent years we have been bringing these experiences to the world of VR too. Head-mounted displays are in everyone's future, and we now make everything we create playable in or out of VR as a matter of course. Immersion via a VR headset makes the mood-enhancing, euphoric nature of our games even more effective. Moose Life is the latest step on our journey into euphoric trance. Created in the style of an 80s arcade game, but in fully immersive 3D/VR. You'll feel like you are inside the mind of Eugene Jarvis Himself. The contents of Eugene Jarvis' brain in 1983. You'll start playing to see all the levels and chase scores on the leaderboards, but you'll keep returning simply because it feels absolutely excellent to play. Commodore 64-accurate mutant camels are just some of the ungulates you can summon to your cause.. You play as a rainbow voxel deer battling to rescue tiny sheep from enemy spaceships, but that doesn't really matter. What you're here for is the feeling of zooming into the screen like some cervine Space Harrier, grooving to some tasty bleeps as you shred enemies into lovely colourful bits with a variety of enjoyably destructive powerups. Glowing stags will stream past your ears as you deploy the mighty 'Stag Party' weapon that turns entire screensful of enemies into harmless, grateful deer. You'll smile. You might exclaim when a particularly lovely explosion blossoms nearby, or when the trip starts to kick in as you traverse the mushroom-strewn planes. You will feel *lovely*.

His long history of crimes made him famous and, over time, he found followers ready to help him. One of them, a Peter Thompson, was brutally killed by his own master. Investigating the murders of the Mentalist, the police found Peter's diary, a very important subject for the investigation as inside were described all the crimes he had witnessed, but above all they found important news about one of the mentalist's many shelters. Peter describes this place in such detail that Roy can track him down, and so begins the adventure that aims to capture the Mentalista and put an end to the terrible crimes of this fearsome murderer. Unfortunately, however, Peter in his notes neglects to mention the huge amount of secret doors and passages that the 'Mentalist' mansion hides and so Roy, unaware of what was waiting for him, decides to venture alone, without help, in fact he is convinced that he can take it taking advantage of the surprise effect, but as often happens things will not thread as expected.

51156,VR Travelling towards World War III Scenario: Post Nuclear War Earth Fantasy,2020-09-15,4.99,0,William at Oxford,William at Oxford,Casual,"According to the Russian Satellite News Agency, a professor at the University of New Jersey in the United States gave the tragic situation after the US-Russia nuclear war. If the United States and Russia use nuclear weapons to attack each other without restriction, most creatures on the surface of the earth will die. Moreover, such deaths are not instantaneous, but last for many years. After the nuclear war, the earth will experience a 10-year nuclear winter. Because the nuclear war will cause 1.47 million tons of ash layer to diverge upwards, enter the stratosphere of the atmosphere, and then within a month, it will cover the entire sky above the earth, making it impossible for sunlight to reach the surface of the earth. The average temperature is less than 9 degrees, thus entering winter mode. Such a pattern will last for 7 years, and then the dust will gradually begin to dissipate, and the entire dissipating time will take as long as Su years, a total of 10 years. If you leave the sun for such a long time, the earth will be devastated. Therefore, no one can bear the price of unlimited use of nuclear weapons. 　　 The earth has entered a 10-year dark winter, which is determined by physical principles. The power of a nuclear explosion is so great that it can roll up a lot of dust and make it enter the stratosphere of the atmosphere. The advection characteristics of the stratosphere determine that these dust will spread over the entire earth with the flow of the stratospheric atmosphere. The physical properties of dust determine that they are strong enough to block sunlight. A layer of dust on the outside will make the entire earth look like a thermal insulation suit. The sun’s heat is difficult to enter, causing the earth’s surface temperature to continue to drop, because according to common sense, everyone knows that the temperature at night will be higher than during the day because there is no sunlight. Much lower. Due to its small size and weight, the dust will flow for a long time in the stratosphere, so it will begin to dissipate after 7 years, and it will take 3 years to dissipate, so the earth will experience a 10-year nuclear winter. The outbreak of the nuclear war not only brought about a nuclear winter, but also turned most areas into contaminated areas of nuclear radiation, from the leakage of Chernobyl in Ukraine and the Fukushima nuclear power plant in Japan to the present decades or ten. Several years later, those places are still very radioactive, and humans cannot enter without protection, and some of the animals and plants inside have mutated. Moreover, a nuclear war will release a lot of heat, which may cause a large number of glaciers to melt, causing the entire sea level to rise, causing many places to be flooded and many places to suffer from tsunamis. 　　 Experts predict that Norway, a country with most of its territory within the Arctic Circle, is likely to have escaped the catastrophe, because its domestic temperature is low. If there is no direct hit by a nuclear bomb, it might have escaped. China News Service, July 23. According to the “Daily Mail” report on the 22nd, scientists in Colorado in the United States used a computer to simulate the scenario after a nuclear war for the first time. The earth will experience 20 years of cold winter, global drought and extensive ozone layer destruction. , Billions of people will die of hunger. Researchers say that nuclear wars in local areas will cause global disasters, so nuclear countries such as the United States and Russia should further strengthen nuclear disarmament.

You will patrol the sector destroying enemy ships wherever you find them, harvest minerals to bolster your defenses, protect colonists arriving from Earth and finally put an end to the planetary invasion. There are ten waves each bringing a new type of enemy ship to the sector that will require different tactics to defeat. You will need to upgrade your ship and base to stand a chance of defeating each new threat. The waves start off in a casual manner but the sector will soon become teaming with enemies as each wave progresses to become a fast paced battle to save the colony. Player Ship Your ship is armed with a powerful cannon and can also be armed with high explosive and heat seeking missiles purchased from the base. Proximity mines are also made available in later stages of the game which are great for doing considerable area damage. You ship has five main systems which can be damaged and are automatically repaired provided your spare parts stock is not empty. When these systems are damaged they will start to fail, your engines will slow, radar becomes hard to read, viewing port gets filled with static, weapons fire erratically and your turn jets will become weak. It is important to keep a close eye on your ships systems, fuel and health statuses. Be sure to return to base for repairs before enemy ships overwhelm you. Note that if the ships weapons are active, the base will not activate the repair tower. Upgrades Asteroids will need to be mined and brought back to the base in order to upgrade the ship and base systems. Ensure you stock up as much as possible before a new wave when new upgrades are made available. An upgrade menu will appear with a mouse cursor when hovering over the base. Many upgrades are available throughout the course of the game, however some are more vital than others. Focus on your ships maneuverability and firepower first to increase your survival rate. It is recommended that you also purchase the homing beacon in order to find your way back to the base with ease. You can otherwise use landmarks in your environment to find your way home. Civilian Transports In each wave a civilian transport will arrive from Earth heading towards the colony which will need to be escorted to arrive safely. Each time a civilian transport arrives safely, an additional cargo ship will be deployed that will provide regular shipments of minerals to your base. You may find yourself a bit battered after an escort, use the jump gate located near the colony to quickly return to your base. Enemies At the beginning of each wave a new type of enemy ship will arrive in the sector with unique characteristics. You can out maneuver most enemy ships to be able to engage from their side.

45289,BeachHead 2020,2020-12-15,19.99,53,Digital Fusion Inc.,Digital Fusion Inc.,"Action,Casual,Indie,Simulation,Early Access","BH2020(VR) is not just a game, but an experience unlike anything else before. BH2020VR is the first-ever entertainment product that integrates gaming and a virtual reality world with its own economy where everyone can participate and prosper. BH is an alternative reality world parallel to our own. It is a truly immersive multi-reality VR experience combining commerce, entertainment, and gaming in one giant evolutionary step. Emerging from the much-loved BeachHead video game series. 20 years ago, BEACH HEAD 2000 changed the gaming paradigm by bringing a new gaming experience to life. 20 years later, the original game creators are ready to do it again. Welcome to BeachHead, a new dimension in gaming and opportunity where everyone is equal, and everyone is welcome. Live in the game world, play to earn, and fight to survive. The original BeachHead 2000 game environment was an anonymous beach in an unnamed country. The country was free of identities and labels -- just like the relentless enemy that tormented the grounds. The land had no anthem, no values, and no moral compass pointing north. Though its inhabitants did not know what they loved -- they knew exactly who they hated, and millions were entranced by the game. They defended that little stretch of sand as if their lives depended on it. The gameplay was satisfying and rewarded the player with immediate gratification, but there was no purpose, no mission, no incentive to immerse further into the alternative reality. That is no longer the case. BeachHead 2020 is the beginning of a new world and an alternative reality in parallel to our own. An expansive world with its own economy where everyone is equal (start from the same place) and everyone is welcome. BH2020 (VR and Desktop) is an all-out, all-inclusive, cross-platform, and fully immersive Virtual Reality game experience that transcends national borders, traditional genres, mediums, and platforms. An alternative world that's culturally diverse, age-independent, and gender-neutral and where everyone is welcome to join the fight. BH2000 was a first-person shooter (FPS) “turret” game, where the player is in a fixed position and is tasked with neutralizing ever-increasing hostile forces as they storm the (beach) player. That is where BH2020 starts as well, but it is only the opening scenario that expands to an ever-broadening VR environment with unlimited possibilities, and evolving gameplay forms. “It’s interesting that even though we’ve been planning, designing, building, and implementing all the bits and pieces of the new BH2020 VR game experience, I was completely blown away when it all came together and put on the VR headset and played the game for the first time. I had my expectations, but it’s not just that it looks and feels great, but that when it’s all working together it becomes something of its own and something that I’ve never experienced before.” – Pepe Moreno They say that humanity (as a species) is at the crossroads of history in its evolutionary saga. One road leads forward and to an enlightened state, the other backward and into the darkness of a totalitarian state. The fight was clear, and the dividing lines were drawn. It was an existential threat, and the battle was to the death. We beat them back in the 2000 wars, but everyone knew that they would be back in force and finish us once and for all. We learned our lessons well, and we built ourselves a fortress to protect our city and our way of life. Ignorance is on the rise again, and if we don't stand guard, the darkness will come again; they will not stop, but neither will we. We will continue fighting together to the bitter end. It’s a bright, sunny morning in the city by the sea. Surfers are beginning to stream from the armored gates in the massive city walls, carrying their longboards across the sparkling sand and catching the morning breakers before they begin to gently relax at the shore. Families are unpacking picnic baskets beside the half-buried pillboxes and camouflaged gun emplacements. Young lovers stroll hand-in-hand between the tank traps. Vendors with beverage coolers and hot dog grills are already in place. Gulls wheel above it all, crying and waiting for a quick free meal before the storm. I was just three years of age twenty years ago today when that pig took the life of my father with his bare hands and robbed me of all the precious moments I could have experienced with my dad. I'm not here to cry and feel sorry for myself; I'm here to fight them off and to get my sweet revenge. My father founded this city and gave us a refuge for our minds and souls from the ravages of violent ignorance. He gave us peace (freedom) and taught us how to defend ourselves The year is 2020, and what remains of a free society has built massive, walled cities called Fortresses to defend themselves from Musso-Kahn, an evil despot bent on world domination. In a relentless onslaught, Musso-Kahn pours the seemingly endless resources of his army, navy, and air force against the last remaining Fortresses. It will require the collaboration of all the Free People within to withstand the assault and rebuild a better world that rejects despotic rulers and the centralizing forces that are menacing and oppressing our world. Join the fight for equality, liberty, and prosperity. There are no moral imperatives and the premise is simple; there are those who respect nothing and only seek conquest and destruction – The Aggressors - and those of us who are forced to fight back to defend our lives, our freedoms, and all that we still hold dear in our way of life – The Defenders. Twenty long years ago, game developer DIGITAL FUSION INC and Global VR revolutionized arcade gaming with BEACHHEAD 2000 VR, a first-ever generation VR game and one of the most popular and addictive arcade titles ever created. Before that, BEACHHEAD shook up the PC world gaming establishment by being one of the first to introduce the concept of quick easy to play, arcade-style games into the early computer market, becoming one of the most internationally recognizable titles of all times. BeachHead is a legendary game with the most incredible saga of addictive gameplay and international success. (for more than 30 years). From the beginning of gaming back in 1982 and the Commodore 64 to the present day, BeachHead has been an immensely successful game brand with millions of fans worldwide and tens of thousands of play in consoles, desktop computers, and in the arcades. We are not new to the notion of VR gaming. In fact, the BeachHead VORTEK Hood in the original arcade version was the first of its kind in the VR gaming world. In 2000 VR gaming was very new and almost nonexistent. Foreseeing that VR gaming would become popular, combined with the easy-to-play arcade-style design, led to huge successes for BeachHead around the world. BeachHead became the number one top-earning game in the U.S. and many other countries around the world. The Beachhead 2020 world would not be complete without the clean, simple, heart-pounding action that made the Beach- Head game series so famous and beloved by millions worldwide. Players can head to the city wall and man stationery or train turrets to defend the city from the relentless assault by Musso-Kahn and his army of death. Beachhead is a city under siege but its citizens work side-by-side to defend the utopian world they have created. Whether manning an antiaircraft flak gun or running a mission into no man’s land the defenders of the city are the heroes that keep it safe and protected. Beachhead 2020 will allow you to earn credits, by protecting the city, or by supplying defense weapons and much-needed resources to the Beachhead Defense Force (BDF). Like in the real world, heroes are rewarded, hard work is compensated, and everyone is welcome. The measure of a great city is the quality of its entertainment. You fight to protect the city and so that you and others can enjoy life in the city. The first segment of the city (punk city) is scheduled to open in Q3 2020 with One-of-a-kind shows, art museum exhibitions, opera concerts, tattoo parlors, casual games, and relaxing places to hang out with friends. Until then, you have some fighting to do to make sure that it will be safe to open.",57,1139.4299999999998,13,1111,41,True,2020

In this Galaxy, there is a planet called Bluestar; She's rich, beautiful, she's transformed into a Wonderful Life form. There is an ancient legend circulating on this planet. Every 3000 years, a comet called 'Star of Hope' will visit this world. It will choose the bravest and kindest child among all living beings and give him a Star of Hope . And this is the origin of the son of the stars . The 'Son of the Stars' will not age or get sick. The 'son of the star' does not ask for anything in return. The sons of the stars are the Guardians of the Promie Galaxy favored by the stars of hope. Every 3000 years, the old son of the star sublimates, the new son of the star is born, and continues to sow hope. It's a good bedtime story that is often told to children, but rarely taken seriously. Until that day, the planet stopped spinning ... Main ASTELL wakes up and finds himself in an underground city, but more than 3000 years have passed. He invites players who participate in the story to find their lost companions and partners, Garfield. Before you left the house, you met the most deadly BOSS in this story, and after the attack, ASTELL came to a corridor, where he got a star, and became the son of the stars of this era. Newly awakened from dormancy, ASTELL had no idea what a Son of the Stars was, and decided to explore the gaps in his memory through clues in the underground city. ASTELL also learned from the message on the board that to restore the rotation of the Blue Star, a special reactor is needed to inject energy into the core of the Blue Star. In the process, he was lucky to get to know Mizi, another protagonist of this work. Mizi never met his own kind, from childhood is by artificial intelligence 'Yun' raised and educated. ASTELL and mizi unlocked the archives and got the blueprints. But ASTELL refused to let Miko take the risk, citing the danger outside, and as one of the underground city's designers, he decided to go find the first part himself. In the course of his exploration, ASTELL encountered many different shadow creatures, and would he choose to defend himself or interact with them? It depends on the player's choice. After solving a series of puzzles, ASTELL arrived at the location of the first part, but unfortunately, the previous BOSS had been waiting for a long time. After a struggle, he got rid of the BOSS and successfully brought back the parts. Mizi found ASTELL wounded, and begged him to go together. Before the second adventure, Mizi made a pair of glasses for ASTELL which will have some interesting effects. On the way to adventure, they learned through the information left behind, in order to be able to accompany ASTELL as long as possible, Garfield upload his own consciousness to the computer; In fact, GARD AI , who has been talking to them, is his incarnation. The two persuaded GARD AI to open the door in front of him, only to take the wrong fork and enter danger again. After a Chase, the two escaped the BOSS's clutches again and found two parts. Who knows, someone's got a head start, and what should they do? Bargainnnnnnn! After a few days 'rest, the two set off again, this time targeting the core of the mainframe. It is not difficult to solve puzzles, but it still requires some observation. It's not ASTELL or Mizi's act In a series of rooms, ASTELL and Mizi learn about the past of the son of the star and the real use of the reactor built by Garfield. They extract the 'hope' that the son of the star can heal all the wounds, and revitalize the cooled core of the Bluestar. Ironically, the last part is on the mainframe that hosts Garfield's consciousness. He was pleased to see ASTELL again, and confirmed that Mizi was a qualified partner. But he also told the two that dismantling the parts would activate the defense, and he would try to fight the mainframe. You've suffered a lot, but you've won a terrible victory. At the deepest level of the building, you place all the parts, and you stand on the platform that's already ready for you. Make a choice. Epilogue/B No matter what choice, no matter what hope, it is the same destination by different routes. You unwittingly achieve happiness for all, and feel sorry for the rationality of all this. But there's still a lot of unanswered questions, isn't there? Who's the Yun? Why did ASTELL sleep for 3000 years? Who's that mysterious man? Why did BOSS want you dead?

It is a tale of sacrifice and difficult choices, in a world under threat of annihilation by the avaricious force of Consumption magic. Magic is powerful, but it is not free. Every spell you cast requires a little bit of your life energy to spark it. Cast enough spells and you will extinguish your very soul. This means you need to be strategic when fighting, balancing the cost of magic with the risk of taking damage from your enemies. How each spell manifests in the world depends on what divine power you choose to combine it with. For example, the Evoke Force spell will cause the ground to erupt with a series of sharp ice crystals, summon a thunderous lightning strike, or barrage the ground with a meteor shower – all depending on what the spell is combined with. Use the magic spells at your disposal to defeat the demons spilling out from the underworld. In Ort, time is frozen whenever you stand still. This means you have the opportunity to plan your attacks and be strategic. Like any RPG, you will be slaying enemies to collect loot and experience. The items you pick up will improve your magical abilities, though some come with curses... As you level up, you will learn additional magic spells to use against your enemies. Ort is varied and expansive, an open world for you to explore. Choose the order of the quests you pursue, or just explore to meet new characters. The final battle is available whenever you choose, but... Are you strong enough? Play as a novice mage, forced to take on the responsibility of saving the world and those that are important to you. Quests can be completed to gain access to new areas, save and unlock allies, gain items and powers, and more.

The game comprises totally new challenges: collect keys to unlock doors, switch the board's gravity to solve puzzles, harness the new power-up system and destroy the Empress' minions! For the first time in DragonScales, Zarya will have to battle against a line-up of multiple enemies. DragonScales 6 concludes Zarya's story arc!

However, the degree of difficulty rises up as you progress. If a puzzle proves to be too challenging, you can always skip the level. Skipping a level does not affect the course of the story. Besides, the game has a single ending. Unlike previous DragonScales games, in DragonScales 6 the power-ups are not entirely optional.

Experience a realistic post-apocalyptic game environment filled with NPCs and other players. Deadside is all about balancing the dynamics of a shooter and the hardcoreness of survival games. The world of the game focuses on realistic aspects of life within the ruins of a dead civilization. You won’t find zombies or radioactive bunny suits here. THE WORLD OF DEADSIDE The world of Deadside is a vast open space full of dense forests and abandoned settlements. Players will eventually have access to an area of about 225 sq.km, entangled by a network of roads and rivers. Early Access playable area will be limited to about 25 sq.km. The world is inhabited by various hostile and friendly NPCs. Exploring the forests, you can face a gang of cannibals just about to eat lunch. Or a group of wanderers trying to survive in a hostile environment. It’s completely up to you how to engage in these encounters. You might just make great friends, or your new rivals contesting the resources of the land. MISSIONS It's a vast open world and in order to avoid getting lost and to keep themselves busy, players can use the map to see where armed bandits are raiding, areas being cleared by security forces loyal to the ex-government, or cannibals settling in abandoned villages. Anyone can take part in mass combat. It will not be an event with a limited number of players, anyone who wishes can go to the mission sector and affect the outcome of the battle. Battles with participation of NPCs and players can continue for hours and the reward will go to the one who can seize the prize loot after the mission is completed. WEAPONS The main features of our combat system are realistic ballistics and hardcore weapon damage. Players will have at their disposal about 19 types of firearms and additional equipment (sights, flashlights, etc.) will be available (at the time of early access). TRADE and “SAFE ZONES” Among endless vast wastelands, wanderers will find places where they can buy ammunition, food and have intellectual conversations about the meaning of life. Maybe swap a story or two about hunting cannibals. Also, there are private lockers for players in Green Zones where they can keep a limited number of things they use for surviving. Green Zones will be places of trade and communication between players and friendly NPC traders. BASE BUILDING and RAIDING Deadside has a simple yet effective craft system that allows players to build bases and use them as shelters to store hard-earned weapons and equipment. Currently, bases have an “online-only” raid system. If you kill other players and they have a base, they might drop a raid token. This token, when activated, shows everyone on the server the location of the base, and it’s raidable for an hour.",26866,537051.34,14782,1356,30,True,2020

So it's not a world apart like in Game of thrones or the Lord of the Rings. It is a copy of our world, but with the difference that there is magic, creatures and magic spirits. What makes this world remain stagnant in the fantastic medieval era. Please note, it remained at this time until our time, which makes it seem like still in the Middle Ages, but much more developed, for example with very dense cities and gigantic castles. It is possible to travel around the world, on five continents via the teleport portals. In Terra Incognita, the dinosaurs are still alive. Elemental magical nature spirits were present when the meteorite that killed the dinosaurs crashed to Earth. These spirits did not stop the meteor from crashing, but they were able to act on certain climatic phenomena, enough to reduce the damage and allow a few dinosaurs to survive. Today they are everywhere on the planet. We do not see them everywhere (we do not find on most game levels) but they are present and that is why we built gigantic barriers all around cities. It is also partly because of the presence of dinosaurs that Terra incognita remained largely stagnant in medieval times, car because of all the dangers that there are on the planet humanity to have had struggling to evolve. Indeed, the game is largely located in medieval times. But not only, it's a bit like in our time, the technological level is not the same depending on where you are located. On Terra incognita, the general level is medieval, but there are also many places of ancient level, even less evolved, until prehistoric. And conversely, some fairly rare places are more advanced and can range from the Renaissance to the industrial era, see modern or even something somewhat futuristic. That is why there is also the presence of techno-magic (a sort of mixture of technology and magic) in certain places on the planet.

We love that sheer easy-to-learn-hard-to-master attitude. The fun of playing with friends in a game where you need tactics, ammo clips, bravery and perhaps a bit of luck. Game Modes TO4: Tactical Operations brings the game modes that we all know. Teamplay on every map with bombing (and/or defusing) scenarios, hostages rescue, the hacking of important assets and escaping with the whole team before the other team finds you. And most important, if you don’t succeed in one of those objectives, you can still kill all enemies. Capture the Flag and Team Deathmatch are working game modes, however are not currently live on Early Access Playing the game The game is a classic round based game. At the beginning of the round you can buy weapons, armour, and grenades with the money you have earned the round before. When you and your comrades are all geared up, you will find yourself in unique worlds where you will have an objective. Complete the objective, wipe out the entire other squad or let the round time run out. The choice is up to you. But it will reward you with stronger weapons, good map rankings and good long fights. Key elements The movement of TO4: Tactical Operations is something unique. The game is fast, an almost arcade-like feeling in a realistic world.

FHM7: Live Every Moment. All new for Franchise Hockey Manager 7: 2D Game Engine: Our game simulation has been rebuilt from the ground up, and now shows games in a top-down, fully-animated view that lets you see every second of the action! Historical International Tournaments: International games have been added to historical play, so you can control a team in legendary events like the 1972 Summit Series and the Miracle on Ice in 1980. We've also added a large number of non-NHL players to the historical database, so if you want to see what the cold war-era NHL would've looked like with the stars of the Soviet bloc added, that's now possible. More Customization for Custom Leagues: We've made the custom league setup much more flexible - you can now add as many leagues as you want, all of them fully customizable. The playoff editor also has a new custom configuration option in addition to the pre-set default systems. Redesigned Scouting System: The scouting interface has been simplified and made a little more visually appealing with the addition of maps showing the coverage your team (and individual scouts) have. Scouting reports have also been changed to provide more useful and relevant information, and Scouting Levels now include an estimate of the player's likelihood of reaching his potential. Reworked Draft Screen: Mock drafts, a draft review, and scout recommendations have been added. Additionally, we've moved the draft dates in modern and custom games - they now occur in early July, as they do in historical, which allows expansion teams to participate in them during their first season. Configurable Historical Evolution: When when you opt to turn on historical editing, you can now specify if you want changes like league foundings/closures, team expansion and deactivation, and rule changes to continue as they did historically or not, in any configuration you want. More Farm Team Control: If you want more control over your farm team, you can now have direct control over their depth charts and staff hiring. Schedule Editing: A long-requested feature, schedules can now be exported for editing, and then re-imported. Waiver and Intraleague Drafts: The beloved Waiver Draft has been added to historical play in the years it existed, along with its predecessor, the Intraleague Draft. Additionally, both are also available as options that can be activated for any other type of league. And that's only the beginning! Other significant changes and additions include: Reworked the news screen to show more headlines and flag personal messages and those which need a reply. Real-life full-career stats are now included on the player screens in historical mode, so you can see if a player is matching his real performance...or cheat a little, if you want to see how a potential draft pick really turns out. A team search tab has been added to the player and staff search. Various international upgrades: national teams run by the user no longer clear rosters after tournaments end, so you don't need to rebuild them, international staff histories are now recorded, and we've made various UI improvements and fixes to get the international screens working a little better. The continue button now alerts to you to upcoming events like drafts and trade deadlines. Database improvements like significantly expanded international stats histories for players, award histories for most leagues, and more The success of a national team now has an effect on the quality of new players generated by that country. Players can now be designated as Untouchable if you don't want to get trade offers for them, and players on other teams can be flagged as 'Not Interested' if you don't want them to be included in trade offers to you. The Aging attribute had been split into Aging and a new attribute, Development Rate to make our modelling of player career arcs more flexible. Roster AI has received a number of adjustments, mainly in the area of how the AI determines player value; most of these are designed to take advantage of systems (line chemistry, etc.) that didn't exist when the last major roster AI revision was done. AI teams' free agent-signing behaviour has also been improved.

Full instrumental soundtrack featuring over 40 original songs! Four cases totaling 20+ hours of story! Full professional Japanese voice acting! The hit Japanese indie detective game crosses the sea for the first time to make its case! Detective. Lawyer. Jury. Judge. The Magistrate of Nakamachi is responsible for the well-being of everyone under his jurisdiction—and for the lives of those who violate the law. Fortunately, the magistrate doesn't work alone. His helpers' responsibilities include everything from police patrols to firefighting to paperwork. Mountains and mountains of paperwork. Shimei Ooka : The newly-appointed Magistrate of Nakamachi, and the game's main protagonist. A scholar and a bookworm, Shimei knows his business, but will he be able to live up to his father's legacy as magistrate? Rimu Hiraga : The tomboy inventor of the century! Rimu joined the Nakamachi magistrate's office as a junior officer, along with her childhood friend and stalwart companion Shimei. Her best talents, though, lean more to the mechanical. Sakura Toyama : The daughter of the Magistrate of Kitamachi. Brilliant, but headstrong; capable, but intensely jealous of the magistrate's office that should have been hers... Koume Kawai : A mysterious girl held in the magistrate's office jail in connection with a brutal murder. Kind, sweet, and clever—but what is she hiding...? A band of vigilante police, outside of the direct control of the Shogunate—and, by extension, the magistrate—yet always willing to cooperate closely for the safety of the city. Their methods can be tough, but they're scarily effective. Together with the more transparent and accountable activities of the magistrate's office, these battle-hardened samurai are indispensable to the peace. Takeru Kondo : The commander of the Shinsengumi. As long as the magistrate is still a rookie, Kondo will remain the real power behind the Nakamachi magistrate's office, but he's always happy to educate the fledgling officials under his wing. Yamanami Ayaka : Vice-commander of the Shinsengumi. Yamanami is beautiful, charming, and extremely attentive to detail. She acts like a mother-figure to the whole Shinsengumi, keeping the dormitory clean and the day-to-day business running smoothly. Shino Okita : A tight-lipped and laconic ace swordswoman. Absolutely terrifying in a fight, Okita is the perfect enforcer. Underneath the surface, though, could she have a softer side too...? Toshikaze Hijikata : Childhood friend to Rimu and Shimei, and a highly-trusted officer in the Shinsengumi. Sloppy as he is in his private life, he's matured into an extremely reliable man. Enjoy daily life in Oukacho, interacting with the townspeople, and building relationships with your friends and coworkers—until an incident disturbs the peace! Interview witnesses and suspects to collect information and build dossiers, investigate the crime scene for material evidence, and explore the town in pursuit of more clues. When you need a breather, explore your dormitory to get to know your friends better! Once your investigation is complete, hold a hearing with your suspects and key persons of interest to narrow down the possibilities and uncover the truth behind the lies! But don't forget: some mysteries are longer-lived and deeper-rooted than any one case. As the magistrate of Nakamachi, will you have the resolve to do what it takes to uncover the conspiracies at the heart of your city and your life?",122,3658.78,104,1297,24,True,2020

416,Texas Holdem Poker: Solo King,2020-03-04,12.99,0,sun xiaodong,sun xiaodong,"Adventure,Casual,Indie,Simulation,Strategy","The game consists of two parts: 1: In the console game section, you can play tournament games and heads-up games against professional-level AI opponents. 2: A complete set of Texas Hold'em calculation tools The table below shows the functional price comparison between the computing tools in the game and other Texas-related computing products on the market. Help players solve two problems: 1: Have a complete tool chain: You have purchased a complete set of Texas Hold'em calculation-related tools at a very cheap price, and it calculates correctly and runs stably. It is cheap, comprehensive, and convenient. One account can share data on multiple platforms, and the functions are consistent, and there is no castration. 2: Learn the playing strategies of professional poker players: You only play games with professional-level AI and learn the playing strategies of professional poker players. There is no random behavior to confuse you with entertaining AI, and I don't want to waste your time. Satisfy player pursuit and advancement: 1: When players play Texas Hold'em, they just want to find and master a set of playing strategies that suit their profession. The professional AI I wrote is written in accordance with the standard textbook-style playing strategies of professional poker players, and they are all in standard poker scenarios. fixed action paradigm, It is very fixed, not random, which helps you quickly understand the playing strategies of professional players. to learn this strategy. Your discovery and learning of patterns will not be interfered with by random strategies. Don't think it's going to be silly, it plays a lot better than most players in online real money games. You can buy it on steam to try its AI capabilities, if you are not satisfied, you will get an unconditional refund within 2 hours, you have nothing to lose at all. This AI uses standard and mature textbook play to fight against you. You can learn the AI's play, understand the AI's play, and find your own way of defeating the AI. It all depends on your own understanding and ability. The AI ​​is not responsible for providing you with the thrill of victory, it is up to you to win. The more games you play in the world of online real money gaming, the more severely you feel you are bound, you feel right, you are almost all playing with a group of professional players who rely on a full suite of scientific tools to give real-time calculations and decision-making cues playing. It was people who were heavily armed like me. In fact, the AI ​​strategy in this game basically covers all my action strategy logic. I wrote it to greatly reduce the energy consumption of my decision-making in the poker game. The strategies in this game are extremely effective at PokerStars blind levels below $10/$20. Further up, I don't want to play games with too much stake, so I can't stand up effectively, so I don't level up. 2): You have learned strategies, and you need a complete set of tools to assist you. Without scientific calculation tools, in real money poker games, you have strategies and dare not use them. The essence of Texas Hold'em is a real mathematical probability game. Data and calculations determine the choice of strategies. In the past two years, the Texas Hold'em books handwritten by foreign professional players who have been translated by the player groups on Taobao are very expensive, far more expensive than my game. Those books cost hundreds of yuan, and they are still very popular. This marks that although the state strictly prohibits Texas games, players' pursuit of strategic knowledge has not stopped. They provided some foreign poker experience and strategies, and I provided a professional training ground and toolset that also filled the gaps for the Chinese in terms of Texas science tools. 3): Optics does not practice, it is natural to learn, and it is valuable to apply what you have learned. You don’t know whether you are cheating or not, and you don’t know why you win or lose. Basically, you are just playing for nothing. In this game, you can freely organize the table, freely set the blind level, freely set the hand range of each opponent, freely set the opponent's AI type, and freely set your own hand range, so that every time the card is dealt, the You're dealt hands in this range, and you're also free to set one of the 20 good hands, so there's a definite training. In the game, the various win rate data, listening win rate, and EV data of each player on each street are calculated in real time, saving you the trouble of manual calculation, and also giving you AI decision-making suggestions from professional-level textbooks. These ensure that you can train fully on demand. and judging whether it makes sense for you. The complete display of this information in the game also helps you analyze the game, so that you know the logic of your winning and losing, where you win and where you lose. Don't think that you lost, it was me who cheated, you can understand whether I cheated by reading the data and graphs carefully, you can't understand these, either you have no knowledge of technology and playing cards, or your understanding is too poor, what? It's all clear, you still can't understand it, and it's clear that you don't have the ability to think, and you can't play IQ games, so don't waste time torturing yourself. Tell you clearly: 1: I sell strategies and tools, and I show you professional strategies in the game. 2: The game is sold at a fixed price. Even if you lose all the chips and diamonds, the server will continue to supply chips and diamonds for you to play. There will be no extra charge. I don't need to cheat you for chips and diamonds at all. , I don't even bother with it. 3: The chips and diamonds provided are enough for you to play 50000 hands. You need about 500 hours to play them all. For the vast majority of players, they will not spend 500 hours on a certain game. They do not give you a huge amount. The chips and diamonds are also to bring you closer to the real world to play from small stacks, so that it makes sense. 4: It is not a multiplayer online crowd gambling game, but a console game, or more precisely, a training tool. The networking function ensures that you can freely share usage data between your mobile phone and computer. This game is more precisely a training tool and a tool for assisting actual combat calculation and strategy. I have provided you with a trainer aircraft and a fighter jet, and it is up to you to combine your wisdom, ability and financial resources to control and use it to assist you. If you think you want to train yourself and experience the brutality of professional gambling, then you can play hard. It provides you with the basic prerequisite knowledge, skill-strategy mix, training environment and toolsets you need from beginner to pro. As a poker tool, the existing functions have completely covered the calculation and decision-making functions of the whole process and all stages required for scientific training and real-time battles. At least it's completely enough for me. There is no longer any free on mobile: 1: Before the V4 version, a free google play version was provided for the convenience of steam players to download the mobile version for free, and for some users who were unwilling to pay to experience the function for free. The new version of V4 will be forced to upgrade from the beginning, and the old mobile phone version will not be able to log in. Old users who pay for it need to ask me for it. 2: Now I don't offer any free versions on all platforms. Now the computer and mobile phones have the same functions, and the google play also has the same price on steam. But you only need to buy the steam version, then you can send me a letter to ask for the corresponding android mobile version. When asking for the android version, you need to provide a screenshot of your purchase history on the steam platform to prove it. Just send me a screenshot of the purchase record information in the email. 3: All versions are unified as paid versions, and the price is the same, which ensures the rights and interests of paying players and the quality level of players. 4: On February 26, 2022, the new version of the server was updated to Alibaba Cloud, with 4 cores of 8G, 10M dedicated bandwidth, 80G cloud disk, and a 3-year lease, so the service for at least the next three years is guaranteed. If you are a streamer and have some fans, you are willing to play it, and willing to share and show this game to your fans, I am willing to provide you with some steam keys. Send me a letter with your platform and number of followers hits: In the battle mode, the range of each player is also shown to you graphically, and the player's hole cards are in the corresponding range. In the pc version, you can select a large resolution in the setting function, so that you can see the range map well in the game. And the most important thing is that it's the cheapest of its kind. manual： We welcome capable agent wholesalers from all over the world to sell the software, I provide retail steam keys in all regions of the world 100~500 steam keys, 30% off 500~1000 steam keys, 40% off 1000~2000 steam keys, 50% off The larger the wholesale quantity, the better the discount {LINK REMOVED} core function: 1: Click the function board card to set the community card, and click the hole card icon to set the hole card. 2: Different player types can be set, and each player has a different range of actions. These ranges also determine different action logics. 3: Equity calculator, draw equity calculator, EV calculator, real-time poker simulator tool. 4: Real-time poker simulator tool, this is the most important for online professional players, which greatly simplifies the time consumption of thinking and performing calculations. 5: Advisor (advisor) provides you with a standard play, the basic guarantee is not to lose money. 6: Before the action decision, provide the EV value of different actions and betsize. 7: Practice the advisor and action EV in the battle mode. Core value points: 1: Poker simulator tool: When playing poker online, professional players can display the complete mathematical data immediately after entering the opponent's range in real time according to the situation of the game table, saving users calculation time and energy, and providing standardized behavior suggestions. These real-time and accurate calculation data and standardized action suggestions help players make quick decisions. Value point: It saves the player's energy consumption in mathematical calculations in the game, and allows the player to invest more energy to focus on the accurate determination of the player's playing range and the use of real-time data to make decisions based on experience. Real-time display of all poker game data, which is not available in other tools. I combined the various data calculation functions scattered in multiple Texas poker calculation software into the real game. The player only needs to determine the opponent's range. In the simulator, Preflop and postflop are also purchased professional range action data, which can be set in the simulator: stacks deep, bet size, and player position to see the real-time advisor. Now this advisor is conservative. range data comes from rangeconverter.com/solution_formats/eight_max-MTT-Complete-Postflop-Addon-NEWOnlineViewer-yearly The core of the simulator is that you need to have the ability to judge the opponent's range of action. This is also one of the most basic and most important abilities of playing cards. If you don’t have the ability to display the range of Texas Hold'em at all, then you can use this tool to repeatedly play poker to familiarize yourself with the range. In the battle mode I provide the ability to display the range in real time. Let you clearly see how different people in different ranges play, and those actions are standard textbook play styles for professional players. Real-time display of complete data: The data standard provided comes from the result of 10,000 times Equity calculated by Monte Carlo method. In the battle mode with AI, you need to turn on the observer mode switch (observer) Data in the avatar frame: 1): EV: 0.70BB, indicating the EV data after the current operation. BB stands for the big blind value. 2): equity data for each street: 2r: 4; 12.93%. Format: 2r (to river equity, calculated to river street Equity): rank (in the current surviving players, own 2r Equity ranked); equity (own real-time 2r Equity, 2r Equity calculated from your own perspective). Indicates that the Equity data to River Street is calculated based on the player's own hole cards against other players' range or hole cards. nd: 1; 72.67%. Format: nd (next street equity, your own Equity on the next street): rank (ranked your own nd Equity among the current surviving players); equity (your own real-time nd Equity, nd Equity calculated from your own perspective). Indicates that the nd Equity data to the next street is calculated according to the player's own hole cards against other players' range or hole cards. cp: 1; 88.23%. cp (current street pure equity, the pure Equity of one's current street): rank (ranked of one's own cp Equity among the current surviving players); equity (your own real-time cp Equity, cp Equity calculated from your own perspective). Represents the calculated cp Equity data on the current street based on the player's own hole cards against other players' range or hole cards. Outs: 30, which indicates the number of draws made by players on that street. At this time, you can open the hands card strength information table, and you can see the probability of the current hole cards and board cards developing to various draws on each street. 1: In preflop and river street, showing 2r is enough. 2: On flop, turn street: displays the complete 2r, nd, cp data, and on flop, turn street, you can see the outs data of the player in that street at the same time. These real-time Equitys and draw data assist in determining the hole cards against other players' hole cards or ranges, their own hands card strength and winning ability, and help them make action decisions on various streets. The betsize window at the top of the interface shows the human player (self) under the current action menu, the EV value ranking of each action in the action menu, the leftmost is the best, and it decreases from left to right (if there is only the leftmost data, then it is According to EV evaluation, this action is the most appropriate, and other actions do not need to be considered). This is based on the action logic shown by the EV. This is also the EV data of each action calculated by the player himself before the action. (The EV data in the avatar range is the EV data after the action, and the meaning of the two is different). This 4-speed EV table of betsize is the data display for making decisions based on EV when displaying the street. In fact, EV has no absolute correct meaning in action guidance before and after the flop (preflop and postflop), and it is not correct to make decisions based on the positive and negative EV. Advisor (Advisor): Shows the decision in this street, comprehensively assessing the following content: player's hole cards, opponents' range or hole cards, current own 2r, nd, cp Equity data and Equity ranked, and the player's own position Table position, player's current stacks deep, current number of people remaining at the table, EV data of each action in the current menu, and bankroll management. The current advisors tend to be conservative, and the goal is to try not to lose money. Advisor also implements a standardized pre-flop strategy in preflop. Advisor also implemented the post-flop strategy suggested by rangeconverter.com in postflop. In the battle against AI mode, you need to turn on the advisor mode switch (observer). Click on the user's avatar to open the user's scope, view or set the scope. Click on the hole cards, you can open to view or set the hole cards. Click on the board card, you can open to view or set the board card. In the simulator, click the D icon to switch the position of the dealer. Click the gray D icon to reset the position of the dealer. Regarding range setting or selection: 1: Provides the standard range for various filling actions in the preflop stage. 2: Provide 24 kinds of action ranges commonly used by professional players. Each professional player divides all hole card combinations into 10 action groups. You can see the action ranges of tag, lag, rock, maniac, and nit players. 3: Provides a view of the opponent's mathematical action range based on the opponent's vpip and pfr. Vpip and pfr can view these two values ​​of opponents from third-party statistical software licensed online, such as holdem manager 2. The graphical Equity calculator provides a complete and correct Equity calculation function. I provide complete toflop, toturn, toriver's montecarlo and Enum calculation methods. It has the same effect as Power-Equilab, and its own data is guaranteed to be correct. When Power-Equilab calculates toflop and toturn, the data is often incorrect (why it is not, you will know by playing with his montecarlo and Enum methods, the longer the calculation, the greater the deviation of the two data, which is wrong), But the calculation result of to river is correct. It sells for $40/year. It does not have a real-time calculation method in the game. It is not suitable for actual combat, but only for review calculations, lacking actual combat significance. PokerGenius: This provides draw data, and my draw ability calculation is the same as his. This one is from the University of Alberta in Canada, which is also one of the two most famous schools in the world that studies AI in Texas, and the other is cmu.

常に行う事が可能です。 システム　信仰ポイント ●信仰ポイント 画面左下に出ている数値が信仰ポイント（どれだけ信仰を集めているか）です。 このポイントが得点アイテムの点数となるので、稼ぐ場合はこのポイントに注目しなければいけません。 信仰ポイントは、緑色のアイテムを取る事で増加します。それ以外に増加する手段はありません。 得点アイテムは、信仰ポイントを高めてから取ることで、大きな得点となります。 出来る限り、緑→青の順番でアイテムを取りましょう。 ●信仰心の減少と維持 信仰は時間と共にどんどんと失われていきます。 緑のアイテムを取って僅かに信仰を増やしても、あっという間に無くなってしまいます。 この信仰ポイントの減少を、一旦停止させる手段があります。 それは、アイテムを取る、敵を倒す等の行動をすることです。 行動した直後、僅かな時間の間は信仰ポイントは減少しません。 この間に別のアイテムを取ったり敵を倒したりすれば、信仰を高いまま維持できます。 （減少停止の僅かな時間は、信仰ポイントの下部に表示されているバーの長さで確認できます） また、ボス戦や会話中などは信仰ポイントは下がりませんが、ミスをすると大幅に減少します。 ●スペルカードボーナス ボス敵がスペルカードアタックという特殊な攻撃を仕掛けてくることがあります。 この攻撃の間は、ミスもせず、霊撃も使わずにボスを撃破するとスペルカードボーナスが入ります。 スペルカードボーナスは信仰ポイントの１０倍から始まり、時間と共に減少しますので、 早めに撃破しましょう。 また、スペルカードアタック中は、霊撃を使用しても敵弾は信仰ポイントにはなりません。 ●稼ぎのヒント ・得点アイテムは画面の上側に近づいて吸い寄せて取ること（基本） ・緑の点と青の点が同時に出た場合、先に緑の点を取るようにすること。 ・信仰ポイントが減少しないように、敵やアイテムのない間を作らないこと。 ・霊撃は敵弾を緑の光の弾に変えます。敵弾の多い所で霊撃を使うのも手です。 　ただし、パワーが落ちるのでむやみに使って苦労しても知りません。 　（ただし敵のスペルカード発動中は、霊撃を撃っても敵弾は緑の光の弾に変わりません） ・敵を倒せなくても、固い敵にショットを撃ち込んでいる間は、減少の速度が 　遅くなります。 ・フルパワーアップ状態では、パワーアイテムの代わりに緑の点が出ます。 システム　エクステンド ●エクステンド 通常ステージは得点が 2000万、4000万、8000万、15000万でエクステンドします エキストラステージは得点が 3000万、10000万でエクステンドします システム　小ネタ ●小ネタ

Meeple Station is an isometric pixel-art space station building and management sim that takes inspiration from games in the vein of Dwarf Fortress and Rimworld. Build a space station up from bare-bone essentials and a skeleton crew, into a bustling metropolis of activity filled with so many Meeple you'll probably forget about a few of them. You picked a great time to hop on board as we're just dropping our major Planets Update just now, which will have your Meeple expanding across the solar system. It's in an early state, but it's the foundation for a summer full of huge feature releases we've been working on and are very excited to share with you! The big recent changes we've added are also part of the bedrock of what is to come. Heee! Meeple need things to live! Ice can be melted and turned into Oxygen, which assuredly your Meeple will need to continue breathing. They also seem to like regular access to food! Make sure they have bathrooms near or you're going to end up with one stinky station. Use Meeple for jobs they are well suited to and house them in decent surroundings or the icy fingers of unhappiness will take hold. Just wait until you see the damage an unhappy officer can cause! Once you make your station a nice productive place to live, it's prestige will spread and draw new Meeple to the station and necessitate expansion. Expansion requires more resources, so get to mining! Meeple Station boasts a robust Z-layer system that is seemingly uncommon in many isometric and management games. The system allows up to 32 vertical floors- so stations can get quite gigantic if you so desire. Trade! At first, you can get things you need from traders, that you can't effectively manufacture on your own. Once you have a good operation going you can turn the tables and make quite a profit from supplying refined resources and manufactured goods to traders based on their needs. With the Planets Update, we've added the very beginnings of the Player-owned ships system, which we plan to expand on quite a bit in upcoming patches. Assign Pilots to ships and fly construction crews to build new stations. That's right! Multiple stations are new to the Planets patch as well! Now that you can travel around the solar system, you're going to be able to build multiple concurrent stations around different planets. Fight off lazy pirates! Pirates gonna pirate. Maybe they did bad in school and space is hard? Whatever the reason, they want your stuff. That's waaaay easier than doing work themselves. Make sure you have guard Meeple to fight them when they come. Station shields and turrets work wonders against bombers. We have so many big things in store for the near future that we hope will floor you with their scope. It's a very exciting time over here in the dev team. We work tirelessly to try to get them in your hands as soon as humanly possible, because we're over-excited children and this is our little passion project we can't wait to share with our community. Eventually, we plan on an inter-station ship-based trading, cargo, mining, and exploration network. It's ambitious, but we really can't wait to show you what we've been tossing into the stew for the future! Seriously, we sit up at night just playing with pixel planets and little tiny shippies. It's a problem. Speaking of community, drop into our Discord and say hello! We love to hear from you all!",753,15052.47,200,1360,23,True,2020

Follow the journey of six Companions, knights sworn to serve and protect the heir of a noble house, as they rise and fall in their struggle to survive a world where one's true enemies are often their closest allies. A NEW ENTRY INTO THE REALM OF CELESTIAN TALES Haven’t played the previous games? No problem! Although the characters and setting will be familiar, nine years have passed in the story and this game stands on its own. Key Features A TALE WITHOUT SIMPLE RIGHTS OR WRONGS There is no world-eating evil to slay, no force of true good in play. Celestian Tales: Realms Beyond is a story of humanity taking shape in a fantasy world, of people pitted against people with clashing ideals and values. • In a quest to stay by your liege, malicious intrigues and conflicting moral principles may stretch your trust in others • A story of the natures of humanity in a world also inhabited by elves, faeries, and giants. • Opposing points of view clash with no clear rights or wrongs, and you make your choice where it counts. A BEAUTIFUL HAND DRAWN WORLD Combining watercolor-inspired environmental art with pixel animations, the world of Celestian Tales elevates the tried and true painstakingly hand-drawn game-making to modern standards. • Detailed sprites crafted pixel-by-pixel and frame-by-frame take classic methods to new heights. • Illustrated character portraits with emotional facial expressions to immerse you in the thought-provoking dialogues. PLAY IT HOW YOU WANT Nobody plays alike. That's why RPGs have parties, right? So whether you're on the 'kill it before it kills you' train, or in the 'slowly but surely' camp, you can create your own perfect party and skill composition to get through difficult fights. • Think two or three steps forward in Celestian Tales: Realms Beyond's turn-based combat and utilize all the advantages you have. • Six characters with unique skills and equipment to be mixed-and-matched to fit into your personal team strategy. • Story plays into combat with new skills embodying each character's personality unlocking as the story progresses. • Difficulty settings that allow all to enjoy the game, lore-explorers and challenge-seekers alike. A COMBAT SYSTEM THAT APPRECIATES YOUR TIME We get it, you have a busy life and a lot of stuff competes for your time and attention. We're simply not the kids we used to be, with loads of free time to splurge on grinding for levels or items. We know that feeling – and Celestian Tales is made for people like us. • Skip the fight-just-too-damn-many-random-encounters! Slither away from them as you like as each encounter is yours to choose. Or just plow through everything in your path if you feel like it. • Also skip the boring drink-some-potions-after-each-battle and heal-party-every-now-and-then part. Stats reset by the end of each battle, so you can hit the road right away fresh and dandy. • Ever thought that encounters that end in two hits (sometimes one!) suck big time? In Celestian Tales each combat encounter is designed to make you think about your next steps. Even against common enemies, mindlessly whacking away can be a recipe for defeat. • All three combinations above let us design battles that matter. So no more enemies soaking your time mashing the normal attack button because you want to save those mana points for the actually important fights.",28,419.72,10,1333,21,True,2020

His first game saw him go hungry, in his third he battled spiders… but 1982’s Horace Goes Skiing – remastered for your gaming pleasure – saw the instantly recognisable character don his skis and hit the slopes. Your first task is to cross a busy road that lies between you and the ski shop – not such an easy task considering the volume of traffic you’ll encounter. Dangerously large trucks, crazy speeding ambulances and short-sighted drivers all add to the fun. Having made it across alive, you can pick up your skis… and now you’re going to have to cross back over. Which idiot built the shop there in the first place? The second stage sees Horace pelting his way through a flagged course; stay within the race zone and you’ll score plenty of points, but watch out for bumps in the course that’ll send you zinging off in the wrong direction. Finish the race and you get the best news of all: you get to do it all over again. But watch out for Horace’s nemesis – you never quite know when he’s going to appear! Despite its apparent simplicity, Horace Goes Skiing cemented its place in gaming history with its mix of simplicity, arcade-action gameplay and a unique graphical style that many retro fans still hold a candle for to this day. This lovingly remastered version is faithful to the original, offering retro fans and casual gamers alike a chance to experience the same thrill as the first generation of players had back in the day. Players can choose to control Horace either using the on-screen touch zones or by using a compatible Bluetooth device. * * * According to the original instructions: Horace Goes Skiing is a sequel to the very successful Hungry Horace. The Horace series pioneers the idea of inter-active cartoons. Help Horace to slalom down the mountain course between the flags and avoiding the trees - but first he must cross the busy roads to get to the ski slopes. A complex, colourful and outstanding computer game. Before Horace can get to the ski-slopes he must fetch his skis from a hut on the other side of the busy road. Horace will move in one of four directions: Up, Left, Down and Right. At the beginning of the game, Horace has $40 to spend. If he is knocked down it will cost him $10 in ambulance fees. After Horace has successfully crossed the road, guide him into the door of the hut where he will fetch his skis. The charge for ski hire is $10. Horace should not enter the ski hut unless he can afford the hire charge. If Horace has spent all his money on ambulance fees, then he can accumulate points and money by crossing the road repeatedly, as at every 1000-point boundary, Horace receives a $10 bonus. Horace should not linger on the road longer than necessary, since the traffic becomes progressively more congested. After fetching his skis Horace must return across the road to the ski slopes. In the second part of the game Horace must ski down the Hannekon run, avoiding the trees and slaloming between the red and blue pairs of flags. If Horace fails to pass between the flags a warning note is sounded and Horace will lose points. Horace can parallel left or right using the chosen control method. Horace increases his points by passing between the flags and he can also receive a 100-point bonus by passing through the finish barrier. As in the highway section, there is a $10 bonus at every 1000-point boundary. If Horace should hit a tree then he can continue on the slope provided that his skis do not break. If his skis do break then Horace must again cross the road for a new set of skis and then return across the road to the ski slopes. If Horace successfully completes the course with his skis intact then he must cross the road once with his skis to the next slope.",3,2.97,1,1164,0,True,2020

However, it was used mainly as a template: the game boasts customized systems and graphics as well as an original soundtrack designed by a team of four creators brought together by their common passion for RPGs! The objective of Lumen is to immerse the player in the atmosphere of classic 2D RPGs, which have been a major part of our youth (Golden Sun, Chrono Trigger). While retaining a strong identity of its own, Lumen is also a homage to this incredible legacy! In Lumen, the Imperium Prod team was at first trying to re-create the feeling of old-school RPGs: exploration, quests, and dialogues with numerous NPCs ... But Lumen has a personality of its own, with varied gameplay and original systems! Here’s a sneak peek. On the three continents of Piastol, Amesial and Dangral, fights are frequent, though no random encounters happen. Foes are visible on the map, and you can decide to elude battle most of the time. However, some more aggressive creatures will not hesitate to charge and chase you! Battle sequences are turn based (with no waiting time) but strewn with mini-QTEs (1 to 3 button presses) to validate the player's choices. It's not just about hammering the action key: using a potion or the last resort ability acquires another taste when your dexterity is also involved! This system is balanced with a counter and evasion system, which highlights the strategic aspect of battle: you can choose to bear the brunt of an attack to counter immediately, or evade to stay out of harm's way. Because it’s not all about action, Lumen is teeming with rich dialogues and encourages the player to discover the game’s world through them. Learn the secrets of Baccus Farm in a full-fledged investigation phase. Argue and negotiate your way through difficult situations using the different members of your party and their distinct personalities to interact with NPCs. A good RPG starts with a good interface. From acquiring abilities with pearls won in battle to buying and equipping powerful items, Lumen takes inspiration from the classics to offer players intuitive menus that work in conjunction with the game’s background.

Her parents are going away for a week of sun and surf in Bordeaux, and Marnie has been palmed off in her grandmother’s care in the backwater English village Fenchapel. Marnie isn’t much looking forward to her week in the sticks. Fenchapel is a small village with a population below 500, without any shops or cinemas. Marnie’s sure she’ll be bored out of her skull – and then, there’s her grandmother’s continued ravings about fairies. “Don’t venture too far into the forest,” Grandma Iris warns. “There are strange creatures in there, and if they find you, they’ll never let you leave.” Of course, Marnie ignores her grandmother’s warnings. Fairies don’t exist, after all – and Fenchapel is so tiny, what can she do other than explore? And so, Marnie wanders into the forest… While exploring, Marnie happens upon a young female knight in a glade, clutching a sword. The knight has been sleeping for many centuries, but Marnie (inadvertently) awakes her. The young knight calls herself Leofe. She does not know why she went to sleep, but she knows that the forest itself is plagued by a horrible curse, and she is the only one who can lift it. Together, the two young girls go on an adventure. They learn of Fenchapel’s storied past, and with the passing days, their feelings towards one another grow. Fenchapel, as it transpires, is far more interesting than Marnie imagined. 85,000 words of text (approx 4-6 hours of reading) A kinetic story with no choices or branches Detailed character and event artwork An entirely original soundtrack A sweet yuri love story A cute female knight!",101,1008.99,99,1241,15,True,2020

A turn-based strategy game with card management and rogue-like elements, with a touch of the adventure game feel. Control the power of the three elements and explore the monsters' den called 'Elemental Abyss'. Elemental Abyss is a mix of card management, adventure games and rouge-like elements. If you're already familiar with card based rouge-likes you're going to be surprised, Elemental Abyss mixes these elements in a new and refreshing way. Monster Encounters During each turn of an encounter, you will have to pick a route for your character. After a route has been picked, your character will follow it, attacking enemies along the way. This might sound simple, but it has a deceptively amount of depths and complexity to it. The different tiles all belong to one of the 3 elements, which all behave slightly different. By moving across the same element you will harness its power, becoming stronger for the turn. Should you power-up for that one powerful attack or is it better to choose a path that attacks the most enemies? Deck Building During the various encounters, you will have to equip your 'Essences'. These will be drawn from a deck of cards and their different powers will help you through the Abyss. Managing this deck of cards is an important part of your adventures, as you will only draw 3-6 cards every encounter. Try to manipulate the deck for the strategy that suits you the best. The Abyss Unlike a traditional rogue-like game, the map of the Abyss doesn't change. This will give you some familiarity that will anchor you in an otherwise changing experience. Each adventure will be very different from the previous one, but by slowly pushing forth into the unknown, you will be able to get closer to the whole picture. This allows you to explore the Abyss in a way that reminds you of a traditional RPG game. At present, the game has the following contents: - 3 classes with a total of 13 characters, each with a their special abilities. - More than 190 Essences available. - More than 200 different encounters. - 18 normal monsters (and their mutant counterpart) and 9 bosses - 36 events that can either help or hinder you.",19,189.81,19,1314,48,True,2020

As your gladiators win battles in other arenas, you will gain money as a reward, as well as reputation. Money can buy new slaves, better equipment, and upgrades for your establishment when needed. Use your money wisely because everything in running an arena depends on it. Reputation is important too, as having a high degree of it when holding a game will grant you considerable income. key Features 1) All gladiators Are Living People All gladiators exist dynamically in the game’s world – not just the ones affiliated with you, but also the gladiators in other Arenas or ones who belong to other masters. NPC gladiators will enroll in different competitions held all over the world every day. They could die, get injured, or grow stronger, just as your gladiators do. Whenever you defeat other gladiators, you can either spare their lives or execute them. If you spare gladiators, you may face them again in future clashes. 2) Rpg Character Development Blackthorn Arena offers players a cRPG character development system. Choose between 6 major attributes,6 weapon types, 8 unique genres, and combine over 100 combat skills to build a unique fighter. There are no classes, so you create your own! Your fighters will also gain various traits during their gladiatorial career. Some of them may have a strong impact on competitions. 3) Diverse Equipment Equip your gladiators with over 200 pieces of armor and weapons, not just for combat effectiveness but also for the aesthetic! Each set of armor has a unique appearance and will be reflected in the game’s advanced avatar system. At the same time, legendary quality weapons and gears are waiting for players to explore and obtain. 4) Abundant Events and Side Missions As an arena master, you must deal with several events every day. Some of them may be opportunities while others spell disaster. Thus dealing with all kinds of emergencies also becomes an important and inevitable experience of taking charge in an arena. Meanwhile, there are a large number of side missions in the game. Players can trigger them and send gladiators to participate in the missions such as robbery of caravans, exploration of dungeons, beast hunting, and many other kinds of quests! 5) Hold Your Venationes! (beast Show) Players can dispatch gladiators to various exploration areas, discover, defeat or capture powerful and rare fantasy creatures, and put them into their arena, as the finale of hosting Venationes. 6) A Variety Of Different Arena Rules The battle between the arenas is not limited to just 1v1, 2v2, 3v3, or 4v4. At the same time, there are different battle modes such as venationes, exhibition, tag fight, throne challenge and tournament to challenge players’ ability. 7) Strong Opponents and Challengers Powerful opponents from all different arenas will come to challenge the players' arena at any time! To defend your glory, or to judge the situation to save your strength? Making correct and appropriate judgments is a necessary ability as a qualified arena master. 8) Real-time Combat With A Tactical Pause The game’s combat is based on real-time, but you can pause it at any moment to issue a command, switch between characters, or apply several other actions. 9) Customizable combat AI and switchable battle mode During fights, you can command only one gladiator at a time. The rest of them will fight automatically. But you can always edit your gladiators' combat AI so that they respond to different situations as you see fit. Besides, the player could switch between automatic combat or manual combat anytime during the fight. 10) Brutal and Challenging gladiator Career The career of a gladiator is cruel and gory. Your gladiators could for example completely lose control of themselves due to shattered morale during the battles. And ultimately, be aware that your gladiators may die permanently when they are defeated! So do cherish their lives, but don't get overly attached to them. 11) Alternative Combat System ： Blackthorn Arena offers players with both real-time Combat System and Traditional Turn Based Combat System. Players could choose either one of two freely by the begining of the Game. ( P.S : Turn Based is currently still in beta , players might encounter serval bugs and issues during the gameplay. We would continually update to optimize it) 12) Non-real-Time Online PVP mode Players can now upload their gladiators to our server! Players can browse the characters uploaded by other players or upload gladiators from their local archives. Players can also choose any team on the leaderboard and click challenge to let their gladiators challenge each other.",3648,72923.51999999999,1410,1321,32,True,2020

Long after the cities stopped burning, and the toxic clouds of fallout had swept across the landscape washing life clean from the world once known as Earth, the dummies continued to play their game of gridiron football . Over the decades, as the tackle-dummies perfected their game, they too began to evolve and to change; once they had been satisfied bouncing about ineffectually on the football fields of old, but as time drove relentlessly onward they gradually began to adapt, utilizing the now silent tools of war that drove their progenitors to their ultimate destruction. In time, they fashioned for themselves a new existence birthed from the ashes of a world long dead. Clad now in aluminum and steel where once there was only vinyl and fabric, the players continue their game. Draped in the names and colors of teams whose meanings were already long lost to the ashes of time. And still the play. A thousand metal fists raised in unison in a cold, heartless chorus of servos and motors rising like an iron phoenix from the rusted carcass of the world.

Many items are not yet usable and some NPC's not discoverable. This is your story... An ice planet called Iclantia is dying. The civilization inhabiting the planet are highly advanced, but not able to stop the coming catastrophe that will wipe out their civilization. What we know from historians is that in an effort to save their dying planet, the Iclantians created what is known as Comets. The Iclantians crafted these time capsules of rock and ice, mixed with technology, to form pods to launch into space. Once discovered, the pods open to reveal a treasure within. They contain the heritage of their civilization: From technology, to history, toys, art, and even weapons. Players find their place in a cluster of suns known as the Rimshot Galaxy. You start in the Remnos system which is home to a variety of alien species. The Remnos system has prospered from the discovery of the comets. Protagonist of your own Story - Crypterion brings you into the game as it's main character. You can customize more than your hair and eye color. What are your likes and dislikes? Have you had a traumatic past experience which has shaped who you are today? NPC's will recognize these characteristics and respond to them. It's like the character creation system in Conqueror A.D. 1086. We take a streamlined approach and ask you some questions. Crypterion also keeps track of any battle scars or physical appearance changes that happen to you. Business Simulation - Do everything you can to run or ruin your business: Trade in goods, invest in the stock market, go on T.V., participate in auctions, buy and run a small business, fill your treasury to the brim, or spend every penny (cryptos) you earn. Story Events - Most events take place randomly though a card system. During the main story you will come across events that are more elaborate in the way they play out. NPC's will talk with you and you'll be able to build relationships. The conversations will have branches and different abilities can be gleamed from them. Officers (Companions) -Companions are NPC's you meet under unusual circumstances that drive the story forward. It's more appropriate to call these officers companions because of the relationships you build with them. ---- Building a company takes years to accomplish and it will be nice to have someone that shares your burdens, watches your back, and grows along side you.

39969,High Strategy: Urukon,2020-05-22,5.99,1121,Iron Boar Labs Ltd.,Iron Boar Labs Ltd.,"Indie,Strategy","This game is a grand strategy enthusiast's attempt to find a purified core loop of decision-making. All needless repetitive tasks are unceremoniously discarded. Instead, you get 10 actions that consume or convert 9 primary resources. Each turn, you (and each AI-controlled faction) get to take one action. The complexity comes from a dynamic world with many interactive systems. The actions you can take: Respond to foreign invasions and natural calamities. Trade one resource for another. Recruit soldiers or labourers from your population. Nurture a city to boost its production. Steal resources from your neighbours. Infiltrate cities in preparation for an attack. Capture foreign cities by force. Negotiate to induce cities to join you peacefully. Build or restore unique landmarks. Excavate in search of resources and unique relics. Some example considerations that you'll need to juggle: Each of the 32 playable factions has asymmetric starting conditions and unique goals. Cities are populated by various combinations of different cultures, which produce and require different resources. Actions affect relations with AI-controlled factions, which modify how they act toward you. There are no formal truces or alliances, and any faction can attack any other faction at any time (with a few story-related exceptions). Some cities are subaquatic, and require a different resource to capture or raid. Cities can be affected by random or circumstance-driven events. 67 unique landmarks can be built or restored to give a powerful bonus. A faction's capital cannot be relocated, and losing it destroys the faction entirely. Capturing another faction's capital lets you seize any relics they own, which are otherwise random finds.",85,509.15,60,1318,32,True,2020

Short, intensive, replayable game loop Rogue-lite with plenty of tools to help you stay alive. Death can be punishing but is not final, you can quickly get back on your feet. Three chapters - each ending with a challenging boss fight, each takes approximately 30 minutes. You can quicken the arrival of the boss by picking tougher fights. Your ship is fast, agile, can dash, use warp drive in combat to jump or perform glory-kills. Your weapons are super deadly and so are the are enemies. Staying Alive Death in SPL is quick and easy, but there are plenty of ways to stay alive, many of them very souls-like: Ships have a passive, indestructible front shield lowered when a ship takes action. If the shield deflects, the reactor heat goes up, what, in longer perspective, can lead to the overheat and a few seconds of shutdown. Bullets can be dodged, by dashing and barrel rolling in any direction. Any incoming projectiles can be countered (parried) by a shield overload. Be careful — inaccurate counter timing can lead to the overheat! Ships can hunker down — rise the full, 360 degree shield — making them impervious to all damage, but slowly heating up the reactor. Get back your lost health (structure) by blasting your way through the enemy defenses and wrecking their ship hulls. You can raise the full shield and become imprevious to all damage and releases a kinetic blast that knocks back enemies. Winning a Fight So you can defend well, how about winning a fight ? Ship main guns never run out of ammo. Instead, the reactor heat goes up bringing you closer to the overheat shutdown. Shooting is about positioning and good timing, not placing the reticle at the perfect spot. You have the same aim assist system as the AI enemies. However, there is still plenty of space for agency and human error. The AI also knows how to defend, but can be beaten in a dogfight, by flanking, right timing, or sometimes with a good, old bullet storm. Very high DPS means a lot of healing, even over your limit. All ships yours including have very effective life stealing abilities. Defeated enemies get staggered and be glory killed for more over-healing and more momentum. Loot Random items drop with random tier, weak enemies will likely drop Damaged equipment, bosses can drop Legendaries. The higher the tier of the equipment the more bonuses it gets. You can equip up to 4 weapons and 3 ship upgrades at the given time. 7 weapon variants, 9 weapon types giving 63 unique weapon combinations, each drops with random modifiers. Proper looter-shooter experience of infinite variations of items. Your equipment is destroyed on death but you can expand your subspace stash to save loot if you get shot down. More powerful enemies drop higher level loot. Weapons with higher level deal more damage, ship upgrades with higher level provide damage resistance. You are equipped with fabricator to dismantle or combine excess items. Wingman You can use your loot to spawn wingman, the better items the more powerful they get. Story The Mind Eater draws all the sentient life towards itself. It devoured the ancient Natives, and now it knows of us, too. Your resistance to Its call, however brief, is our glimmer of hope. Tutorials A well tested, polished set of four tutorial missions that will introduce you to the details of the game unique mechanics. Three ship status bars are displayed: Heat – most of the actions generate heat. If you overheat the ship, it will take a few seconds to reboot the reactor! Armour — regenerates if you reactor is cool (at 0% heat). Structure — living metal that runs inside your ship, as well as inside the hulls of enemies. If you hit enemy directly, the liquid structure ejects from their ship and can be collected to repair your vessel. Enemies can heal in the same way! Flight Remember, there is no speed limit in the space — after the acceleration you will maintain your current speed until deceleration or hitting an object. Ships warp reactor allows you to accelerate freely in six directions, without changing the ship orientation, and with full freedom of motion. Feel free to strafe sideways or fly backwards, regardless of your camera orientation. The jump drive provide a quick acceleration to thousands of kilometers per second with the freedom of flight path within the space. The ship will automatically abort the jump after you reach an obstacle. You can also use jump drive to outrun your own bullets! Enjoy the open space and fly anywhere you want — the game will always come with surprises and give you challenges on the way. And last small tip – when the situation gets though, don’t feel dishonored by escaping any encounter or combat. Just jump away, heal up and get back into the fight!",12,179.88,10,1125,0,True,2020

Vulcania Island : Vulcania’s boards contain bugs! Hopefully, not 'programming bugs,' but little creatures on cells of the board. We have to surround those bugs with letters, and also catch all of the mystic letters. Nuntel Island : These boards have a timer! Don't worry, though, as the timer fully restarts with each word you place on the board. Raspit Island : This island introduces an additional requirement, as any new word you place on the board will have to include orange tiles. Each time you play a new word on the board some of its letters will have their tiles colored orange. And your next words will have to include at least one of such letters in orange tiles.

They will share their lives with you. ----------------------------------------------------- The long version... Behind the Horizon is an epic role playing game with farm elements. It takes place in a living world and is based on a nature simulation. The farm part of the game fits harmoniously into the whole game and provides a lot of variety with housing, crafting, animal husbandry and farm decoration. Vast underground areas designed by hand and filled with good and bad surprises offer excitement and challenges. Behind the horizon offers a long mystical story away from 'Hero saves the world'. Rather it is about discovering one's own nature and the nature of the world. The community of Woodhome and the contact to the inhabitants plays an important role in this. All residents have their own daily routine, which also changes with the seasons. There are craftsmen, traders, artists, a café and a restaurant and all live in a friendly community together. You can talk to all the residents and many have small or big tasks, or can do something for you. From time to time there are decisions to be made which can have consequences for you and the world. Of course there is also friendship and love behind the horizon, but I will not reveal anything about it now. The Nature Simulation makes sure that no game is like the other and that the landscape changes every day. The weather and the seasons are also simulated and have a direct influence on nature and the player, and there are catastrophes and special events in the simulation that can dramatically change the landscape again and again. Plants grow and sow, trees die and give the soil its nutrients. The soil continues to develop and becomes more and more fertile. So the world is constantly changing. More than 50 cutscenes that advance the story or breathe life into certain moments. These include events such as learning new skills as well as visions and information about the main story. The story itself is told in 5 chapters. In the beginning the focus is on survival, working on the farm and exploring the world. Afterwards the story picks up more and more speed and finally ends in one of two possible endings. There are hundreds of items , which you can find in the dark dungeons, buy from merchants, or make yourself. Potions, spells, all kinds of food and many other useful items can be made on the farm. There are numerous recipes for the decoration of the house and farm, and many items can also be bought from local traders. Also magic is not unknown in Behind the Horizon and the study of the nature of magic is a central point in the story. There are more than 40 different spells that can be used for combat or on the farm. The combat system has 5 weapon types and the corresponding skills must first be learned from inhabitants of the world. Huge underground caves and dungeons with traps, labyrinths, treasures and many surprises await you. There are various boss enemies with sophisticated mechanics. In total there are over 25 different monsters with many unique abilities. For Farming there are many cultivated plants and also ALL wild plants and trees available for cultivation. Animals can be kept in enclosures or stables and small, helping companions are also available. The harvested plants serve on the one hand for own nutrition, for cooking and making magic formulas and on the other hand of course to get the coins to be able to buy stuff from the local traders. How the mix between Farming / RPG / Exploring Caves and Housing looks like is up to you, but it should be said that you can have a lot of variety.

In recent years, countless pop idols have launched new careers, some achieving fame and fortune, others falling into obscurity. Competition is so fierce, people have started referring to this era as the 'Warring Idols Period.' Down on his luck and forced to leave his employee dorm, young producer Nobuyuki Kinoshita runs into an old friend, Ai Amane. Little does he know that this chance reunion will have far-reaching consequences. After inviting Nobuyuki to move in with her, and learning that his company is running low on talent, Ai makes a suprising declaration: 'I want to be an idol!' Now, Ai is determined to help Nobu save ODA Productions from bankruptcy, and to transform her own life on the path to becoming an idol. ★ Character★ Ai Amane (天音 愛) CV: Yoshino Mizuse(水瀬よしの) Height: 158cm Weight: 49.5kg BWH measurements: 87/60/86 'The Sweet-and-Innocent Girl Next Door' Ai and Nobu were friends when they were kids, but they lost touch after her family moved away. She came to Tokyo for college, and offered a helping hand (and her apartment) to her old friend in his time of need. A young woman who treats everyone she meets with equal kindness, she practically exudes an aura of purity. Sometimes it's hard to tell if she's really just that nice, or maybe a little niave. Smart and athletic, she may seem perfect at first, but she can be surprisingly stubborn at times. She also has a more laid-back, casual side that she only shows in private, and to those she truly trusts. Ai's kind heart can sometimes get her in trouble. She has a habit of throwing her all into helping people, treating their problems as her own, while forgetting to take care of herself.

Although she may seem ditzy, when it comes to idols she knows everything there is to know. She's always ready with some frank advice to help Ai learn the ropes of her new profession. Rumor has it Miwako once dreamed of being a successful idol herself, but came to realize she wasn't cut out for it. Her new dream is to support others from behind-the-scenes and help them be the best they can be.

A: Two mini-angels live inside the the head of a big angel, and they're both trying to kill one another -- and they both have 7 points. Q: Why 7 points? A: It's actually very simple: numerologically, the number 7 symbolizes humanity's deep inner need to find meaning and spiritual connection; Uranus is the 7th planet counting from the Sun; therefore: the game's soundtrack procedurally remixes 21 (7 x 3) music samples based on player input and score (7 points). Q: What? A: Yes. Q: Is there actually Doraemon porn in this game? A: No. The game features no Doraemon-related pornographic material, or pornographic material of any kind. Q: Who is Jason Bourne? A: 'Jason Bourne' is the alias of David Webb, a fictional US Marine and CIA officer created by novelist Robert Ludlum. Q: Why is Jason Bourne always on the run? A: Because he lost his memory, he can't remember who he is, and there's some shady people trying to catch him or something. Q: But why, though? You didn't really answer my question. A: Bourne's wife and two sons were killed during the Vietnam War when a fighter plane dropped two bombs in Cambodia. However, due to Cambodia's neutrality in the war, every nation disclaimed the plane, and, therefore, no one took responsibility for the incident. Infuriated by both the utter injustice and randomness of his loss, Bourne went to Saigon and ended up training for an elite Top Secret Special Forces unit called 'Delta One'. Years later, Bourne was tasked to murder Nykwana Wombosi, an exiled African warlord. He infiltrated Wombosi's yacht, intending to arrange the murder to look like he was killed by a crew member to avoid suspicion. However, Wombosi was surrounded by his children, and Bourne was unable to bring himself to kill him. He tried to abandon the mission by leaving the boat, but an unknown shooter shot him twice in the back, sending him off the yacht into the sea and triggering amnesia, causing him to forget his identity. Q: If he lost his memory, then why does he know Kung Fu? A: He doesn't. Q: What about that time he jumped through a window from a rooftop and killed a bunch of people by air-kicking them in the neck? A: That's not Kung Fu. Q: Ok. But still: if he can't remember his name, how can he remember all his Kung Fu moves? A: People who suffer from retrograde amnesia still retain their muscle memory -- meaning that he still remembers all his years of training in martial arts, even if he can't remember who he is. Q: And why is he robbing a Casino with George Clooney and a bunch of other people? A: That's Matt Damon, not Jason Bourne. Matt Damon is an actor who plays Jason Bourne in the Jason Bourne movies. Q: But why do they need him if: - A) he barely does any Kung Fu in that movie, and - B) they already have Jet Li on the team? Jet Li's Kung Fu is way better than Jason Bourne's. A: That's not Jet Li, that's Shaobo Qin. Q: Pretty sure that's Jet Li. A: That's not even a question.",20,79.80000000000001,20,1119,7,True,2020

12353,Power & Revolution 2020 Edition,2020-09-17,49.99,7518,Eversim,Eversim,"Simulation,Strategy","In Power &amp; Revolution 2020 Edition, play as the Head of State and extend your influence around the globe. By playing as several countries, try to change the destiny of our planet with orchestrated actions. Play as the head of the legal or illegal opposition and seize power! With the new scenarios in Power &amp; Revolution 2020 Edition, try to contain the Covid-19 pandemic and revive economic activity, participate in the 2020 US presidential election or engage in lightning wars to add conquered territory. STRATEGY, SIMULATION AND MANAGEMENT Power &amp; Revolution 2020, is a simulation of our current world, recreating its features in-depth and across a number of domains: economic, political, military, social, financial, environmental, energetic, transportation... All countries of the world are represented with their own features. The calculation and scenario engines include more than 100,000 data, 15,000 texts and 10 hours of recorded dialogue. A detailed and animated 3D world map helps to support the players, with all the borders, regions and important and strategic locations of the world The game combines management stages of economics, commerce, wargames, construction, espionage, simulation, and political influence and manipulation. Players can opt for the management of just one country or several simultaneously and design collaborative strategies to change the world's destiny. There are game settings across multiple domains: degree of activity of terrorist organizations, probabilities of natural disasters, reactivity of populations, outbreak of wars. More than twenty contextual scenarios with current events from today's world are integrated. 2020: A TURBULENT YEAR! As the year 2020 begins, the Covid-19 is spreading... As the head of one or several nations, take up the greatest challenge of the human race since the Second World War as you try to contain this health crisis and its economic impact. This game also offers multiple scenarios: a simulation of the world without the Covid-19 pandemic, a glimpse of a future with the emergence of an even more dangerous virus, participation in the 2020 US presidential election, the transformation of the player’s political system into an absolute monarchy, and various ongoing conflicts which showcase the new wargame functions (formation of squads, missile silos, anti-aircraft batteries...). A TOTALLY UNIQUE SIMULATION ENGINE The game engine, Geopolitical Simulator 4, includes over 600 data elements for each of the 175 playable countries and calculates their changes in real time throughout the game based on players’ actions. Some examples include popularity ratings, political relations, and economic exchanges between countries. Various organizations, including NATO, use the technologies in the Power &amp; Revolution simulator for education and training. Over one thousand playable actions. At the country’s helm, the player/head of state can act in many areas: budget, taxation (nearly thirty types of taxes), currency, economy (over 130 economic activities), foreign and domestic affairs, defense, society, labor, health, social security, education, environment, transportation, culture, and more. Propose bills to be voted on in Parliament, for example: setting social welfare benefit minimums, changing the retirement age, developing atomic weapons in secret, subsidizing the auto industry, hiring teachers, defining the powers of unions, setting speed limits on roads, regulating prostitution, creating an international film festival, etc. The player can also construct elements on the world map, which will change accordingly: nuclear plants, wind farms, military bases, pipelines, high-speed train lines, airports, and many more. SIMULATIONS OF MAJOR GLOBAL THREATS The Geopolitical Simulator 2020 Edition simulates all the major perils that threaten the planet and produces a comprehensive assessment for each one from the results along with specific graphics. The list of threats is substantial and many of them are interconnected: global warming, the widening of social inequality, the risk of global atomic war, overpopulation, unemployment, atmospheric pollution, terrorism, cybercrime, regional conflicts, food insecurity, world hunger, deforestation, natural disasters (storms, floods, drought, extreme heat...), rising sea levels, ocean acidity, disappearance of animal species, climate refugees, epidemics, endocrine-disrupting chemicals… PLAY AS THE OPPOSITION At the head of a legal or illegal organization, the player can take power by force, revolution, diplomacy, or democratic election. To that end, players have many actions at their disposal: manage the budget of the party or illegal organization, intervention in the media, give voting advice to Parliament, launch protest movements, lobbying, manipulation of influential persons, funding or recruitment campaigns, creation of violent cells, purchase military equipment, raise an army, seek allies, engage in armed conflict... During elections, players must manage their campaign budget, establish their political agenda, complete their meeting itinerary, confront their adversary in televised debates… AI CONTROLLED LOBBYISTS AND CHARACTERS All actions of the player as head of state or opposition have repercussions and lobbies, social groups, and important national and international figures will intervene if their artificial intelligence deems necessary (press interviews, resignations, protests, strikes, unrest, blocked roads, wars...). To prevent tensions or forge alliances, the player can meet any figure during the meeting or intervene in the media (more than 10 hours of dialogue in the game). REALISTIC WARGAMES AND CITY BATTLE PHASES The world map incorporates all places of conflict down to the smallest detail: occupied territories, besieged cities, locations of military units, international military bases, personnel and equipment of terrorist groups... As a warlord, players can direct all of their units from real bases during military conflicts. City battles are shown on precise maps with all the major buildings and intersections. The players, according to the side they represent, can direct police, hooligans, military personnel or armed extremists to these locations and construct barricades, send in snipers, loot the banks, or have armoured vehicles move in. SECRET SERVICES Secret services play an important role. They have an arsenal of espionage and \'special\'' operations: reveal scandals about an opposing political party, dismantle terrorist networks, sabotage foreign infrastructure, assassinate an opponent, send reconnaissance drones or position satellites to locate enemy units, etc. INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS International organizations (over 50 organizations included) play an important role. At the UN, for example, the player can denounce a nation in order to obtain the Security Council’s authorization for a military intervention. The player can also create his or her own organization. INCLUDES MULTIPLE OPTIONS • Game operating as single-player with a multi-country mode allowing play with several countries simultaneously • Game settings: terrorist activities, probabilities of natural disasters, reactivity of the populations, outbreak of war • Player ranking online and in real time • Incorporation of your own photos, logos, names to make the game even more realistic • Interactive tutorial and game help available at all times during the game (in beginner mode) • Learn about geopolitics by playing the QUIZZ mode, including more than 3000 questions • Enjoy different configurations with double screen or 4K screen offering a customized interface • Avec l'extension Modding Tool, (add-on prochainement en vente sur ce site), vous aurez la possibilité de créer et de partager vos propres scénarios et contextes géopolitiques ou bien de télécharger ceux des autres utilisateurs • With the Modding Tool extension (add-on soon available for purchase on this site), you'll be able to create and share your own geopolitical scenarios and contexts or even download those of other users • Text and dialog 100% in English NEW CONTENT FOR 2020 Simulation of the Covid-19 Pandemic... Based on actual data, the pandemic is recreated and the player can follow its progress with various graphs, stats and maps and is kept up to date directly by their Health Director. Numerous tools and legislation are at your disposal to try and slow the spread of the virus: managing inventory and distribution policies (masks for professionals and the general public, screening tests, treatments, ICU beds), construction of temporary hospitals, an arsenal of lockdown measures (for the population, for schools, businesses, bars and restaurants), limiting gatherings and travel, regulating transportation, closing the borders, use of tracking software, transfer of patients and vaccine research. All of these measures can be customized by region and their level of contamination, the objective being to stem the pandemic as quickly as possible and to slow its progress to limit the impact on the economy. ...and the Economic Crisis Depending on the situation, the player can impose, or lift, restrictions on businesses. In response to the decline in business, various measures can be put into place: partial unemployment, aid for the poor or support for struggling economic sectors to minimize unemployment and the decline in growth. The debt and deficit of a country can be strongly affected by this crisis and if, in the short term, the State can rely on international lenders, especially when a member of the European Union, then the player will have to return to more acceptable levels in the long term so as not to alarm financial markets. Other Scenarios In 'The World Without Covid', the player can lead their country in a 'normal' context, without the pandemic. In the 'SARS-CoV-3 Mutation' scenario, set in 2022, when, after a widespread vaccination of the world population for Covid-19, researchers discover a new patient carrying a virus that seems to resistant to the vaccine. Has the virus mutated? The pandemic crisis plunges the world into turmoil: in the 'Coronation' scenario, the player can take advantage of the chaos to install a royalty and become an absolute monarch. Wargames Scenarios and Functions A number of units and functions have been added: anti-missile and anti-aircraft batteries which can be deployed to concealed locations to intercept aerial attacks, intercontinental missile silos and anti-aircraft silos that are difficult to destroy and can launch missiles at a very long distance, formation of squads which allows the movement of units as a whole to be able to attack as one or to defend each other, area bombing from cruisers that targets multiple enemy units in a single run, forming groups of satellites or drones to cover a larger area, the addition of anti-missile armaments for carriers and certain cruisers, the addition of a 'Fog of War' mode, concealing stationary missile launchers and reinforcing the defense of military bases. A special mini-guide describes the function of all military units in detail. Numerous lightning war scenarios reflecting the geopolitical context of potential conflicts in which large nations claim foreign territory. The player can choose to play as the aggressor, attempting to annex enemy territory within a certain amount of time; as the defender, fighting back while the international community mobilizes and forces the invaders to retreat (China vs. Taiwan, Russia vs. Georgia, Turkey vs. Libya...) 2020 US Elections Choose your Republican or Democratic candidate and launch your campaign to become the next president of the United States.

For millennia, they explored every corner of the universe: in the end, after some time, they created five intelligent races who they implanted on many planet across the galaxy and then they left, continuing their roam into endless expanse. Over millennia, these new races evolved and began their expansion in the universe, colonizing new worlds and founding empires more and more big. Every race worshipped the Infinitian as Gods, always seeking their consideration, but even in the sporadic circumstances of their passage through a star system with their enormous spaceship, the Infinitian simply ignored the race, persisting in their own way. For thousands of years, everything in the galaxy relatively worked out, until the day the Infinitian simply disappeared from the universe, without leaving almost any sign, like they never came to existence.

Most often, there is no specific algorithm of actions, you should rely only on your intuition to solve the problem. We have added new types of platforms that interact with objects in different ways. For example, there are platforms that make round objects to roll in a certain direction. There are transparent platforms that are divided into colors and can only interact with objects of their own color. There are game levels of different difficulty and types. Some levels require dexterity and reaction, some will require patience and caution, others will make you think about the sequence of actions. You can see how to interact with an object by its color. For example, green is the main color, and you need to deliver it to the platform of the corresponding color. Yellow object reacts to explosions from mouse clicks. Blue objects are destroyed when they collide with yellow ones. Blue ones are not destructible, but they can be moved by yellow objects.

Win the hearts and minds of America’s voters and take the 2020 presidential election by storm in this exciting political strategy game. Choose from a large roster of candidates, from Democrats Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders to Republicans Donald Trump and Mitt Romney, as well as other well-known politicians like former senator John McCain, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Mitch McConnell, Barack Obama, and more. Want to shake things up a little? No problem! Use the Candidate Workshop to create your own frontrunner, complete with customized statistics, ideologies, and design. If you believe everything is going to hell in a handbasket, you can play as one of the wild card candidates like the Giant Meteor and adopt some truly crazy ideologies (ban all video games - they’ll rot your brain!). The Political Machine 2020 features unique ideology trees for each of the candidates that allow them to play very differently from each other. Throughout the game, you’ll visit Town Halls or take on Campaign Events to gain ideology points that you can spend to own certain issues. For instance, Bernie Sanders has ‘Medicare for All’ as an issue he can own, while Donald Trump can use points to purchase the ‘Build the Wall’ issue. Each issue is modded on a per-state basis with their voter support based on data in order to allow for an accurate simulation of how those issues will play out in different states. It’s important to win 270 votes in the electoral college, so you’ll need to pay attention to what issues voters care about in the swing states. What plays well in Texas or California might hurt you in Ohio or Florida. The Political Machine 2020 is a complete rewrite of the original versions of the game with vastly improved graphics and a more sophisticated simulation that combines polling data, voter enthusiasm, and the most recent US census results to deliver a game that is both fun to play for casual players, and realistic enough for political wonks. Do you think you have what it takes? Take to the campaign trail and show the nation why you should be the next President of the United States of America! Core Features Spread your Ideology - Participate in Town Hall events to earn ideology points and solidify your position on hot issues with your voters. Generate Enthusiasm - Use your power and money to purchase ads to discredit your opponent and influence voters. The greater enthusiasm your base has for an issue, the more effective your ad campaigns will be. Participate in Interviews - Accept invitations to various talk shows across the country in order to share your opinion on issues important to the American people. Choose your Candidate - Play as one of several candidates, each with their own custom stats like stamina, intelligence, charisma, media bias, and more. Manage your Campaign Budget - Purchase advertisements, travel across the country to campaign, and hire operatives to enhance your PR or cripple your opponent. Be wary - if you overspend and need extra cash, it might come from somewhere that will shake voters’ confidence in you! Create a Candidate - Customize your own front runner and race for the White House. Practice your Politics - A sophisticated underlying simulation model uses census data and real issues to test your political savvy. Be Ready for Anything - Torrid affairs, natural disasters, email scandals, and other “breaking news” events can pop up and change the direction of the campaign for better or worse. Check your Standings - With poll tracking and leaderboards, you can see how well people are playing as their candidates or what issues they are supporting over time.",713,10687.87,460,1398,21,True,2020

You will meet extraterrestrial races while fighting for survival and conducting diplomacy signing treaties between empires, trade agreements to full-blown partnerships, and even create protectorates. In Space Empires, the player assumes the role of the single leader of a race of intelligent beings that has recently acquired the technology required to build large fully space-based ships for interplanetary and interstellar travel. Starting out with only a few possible hull sizes for their ships, on which they can place any number of components to essentially create a unique ship, the player can research new hull sizes and components to use with them, eventually being able to build ships ten times the size of his original hull size. The components available to the player can vary greatly, from ship bridges, long-range scanners and shield generators to emergency supply components that, when used, will be destroyed but will allow a ship to continue moving for a longer time, and of course, weapons of various kinds, boarding parties, cloaking devices right up to Dyson sphere construction material and star-destroying devices. The player can meet extraterrestrial races (which will inevitably happen as the player expands their realm) and conduct diplomacy with them. Treaties can be signed between two empires, varying from the basic trade agreement to full-blown partnerships and even protectorates. The player can also conduct intelligence operations, from simple information gathering missions, to ship bombs, to inciting rebellion on a planet. Interstellar travel in Space Empires is not faster-than-light drive based, but instead relies on anomalies called 'warp points', essentially wormholes between two star systems.

Along the way, you'll fight hordes of enemies, both dead and otherwise, as you'll try to understand your place in this world. Combat is simple, rock-paper-scissors based, but the sheer amount of enemies makes the levels difficult. To overcome obstacles, you have at your disposal twelve abilities.

They're like zombies but less gross and pretty harmless and just want to live normal lives. So even tho they don't have brains or bones, they still try to go shopping, drive cars, or go to dates, not necessarily doing a good job at that. But there's one person who is not OK with that. YOU! So you decide to save the world from these weird creatures. But there's nobody else left in the world but them so you end up just getting in their way for giggles.... or do you? Features Nearly 1 square km of interactive city to explore (and destroy) Ability to build (and destroy) things yourself! Rockets, explosives, engines and other cool stuff to build with Story Mode with probably the most ridiculous plot in video games. Saving replays to gifs! Also, a bunch of things I totally forgot Premise There are many VR games out there and every time I try to play one, the first thing I try to do is destroy everything around me, and most of the titles are rigged to prevent me from doing that, and to keep me focused on the actual point of the game. Thus, I decided to create a game that will let you destroy everything. Hell, it will let you create things you can destroy later and it will allow you to share the destruction with your friends, people on the Internets, and any passing alien spaceships that somehow end up picking up your stream. The idea behind Mosh Pit Simulator is, that you are inside a video game, with those weird humans, all governed by video game rules, but since you wear VR goggles, not all of the rules apply to you. In VR, nothing really exists, so you can lift everything up easily, punch with near-infinite strength and wreck total havoc to the extent where physics engine can't cope up anymore. Creation This game was created by accident. The development began in April 2016, when I got my hands on the Vive Development Kit. After playing some games, I decided to give it a shot and create something. I used a human model I have created back in October 2015, and since I had no AI and wanted to interact with the humans quick, I added a simple AI algorithm: if chest is below 1m, bump chest up . This is the AI that drives all the humans in the game even now. I started punching the humans around but it was no fun, so I cranked up the punch strength, albeit a bit too high and ended up producing a GIF of me punching these humans that promply went viral. When I woke up next morning I realised that this is the game I have to make now. Here is the original gif. FAQ Q: Why 'Mosh Pit Simulator'? A: It's a fact the game has little to do with actual mosh pits (the weird bumpy dance thing people do at rock concerts), but as this was the working name, pertaining to the caption of the 'original GIF', I decided to keep it as the in the game, the entire world has become a giant mosh pit that never stops. Q: Do you have a Discord server? A: Yup, check out the Community Hub for a link to that! Q: Is this game an asset flip? A: Haha, no. I'm only one person working on this game, so when I need a bus in the game for you to play with, I can either model a bus and rig it and texture it and spend few days doing that, or I can spend $5 and grab an existing model and juice it up a bit to at least roughly match the style of the game. Enough busses have been modelled already, and I can focus on making the game play better in the saved time. Q: Why are there only dudes? A: The humans in the game do not really have a gender and are supposed to be more like mannequins than actual humans. They don't have brains as well and they are empty inside (in VR you can put your head in and see for yourself). They have neither soul nor nipples and should be regarded as weird non-gross zombie creatures more than humans (even tho I keep calling them that, it's just a name I gave them) Trailer Song Lyrics blerghe blergvhe beeghlurgh blurghve blughlurghu bleerbregh blyrghbu blergha bleeergh blahgerbleh blargh blegho blergh blghrebleh bleh bleh gheerle blargh blargh bloorgh reekapoo dideda bahdeydoo reebah deh keh peh deh booh booh booh bahrah behreh gihdee behre beh beh rehgehse phoo hoo pochoh pah dah pah rrrraawrrr behrhe ghedeh voh reh gehdeh voh reh gedheh blergh blergh blergh blergh blergh blergh bleughrg rehghe bhedeh boh reh vehdeh goh reh vedheh bleughrha deugrlha heurghla bloorgh wohahla bee ibeedeewo raahrghl raahrghl raaaahrghl rahrghl rrahrghl rahrghl rahrghl rahrghl rahrghl raaaaahrghl ribidibooh glaargh rghley dharhrara glebrgh glebrgh glebrgh glebrgh glebrgh glebrgh glebrgh glebrgh glebrgh grhbgleehbrghl",64,639.36,36,1391,0,True,2020

Jake has just received a call from his friend Lilly whose house is surrounded by the living- dead. The young man will have to cross the city to save his loved-ones. His journey will be strewn with pitfalls. Luckily, he can call on an impressive arsenal. He has little time in which to act and to do so, he will need to eliminate the threats: zombies, skeletons, the bosses… A whole world of terror, coming straight out of hell. The countdown begins !

These weapons are unlocked at the end of the winning game and, above all, according to the number of points obtained. ENEMIES Enemies are numerous and come in three categories. Zombies, skeletons and the Bosses. Their powers grow during the game and some of them can handle guns or have superpowers. The skeletons are generally faster and better equipped. Coming from the most ancient cemeteries, they are from an era when swords were used as weapons in battle. They wear protection, use shields and are particularly good at fighting. They are generally present in the countryside, around big cities, in villages or forests. Some, more dangerous, live in the catacombs… By definition, the zombies are slow but they move in numbers. They like to make human contact and approach Jake to try to devour him. Some are more intelligent and may use weapons, but they are rare and appear in the very last levels. They are usually present in the city or on the main roads. The Bosses are larger, more powerful and have been genetically modified by the army. They escaped from a secret laboratory and put the surrounding chaos to good use to climb to the top of the food chain. Their attacks are devastating and risk destroying you, if you are not well armed. ASSAULT WAVES Each level features 3 waves of enemies, with Bosses punctuating the adventure at strategic points.

You will have to control where your resources are diverted to and ensure that there are enough workers to fulfill your missions. Don't be fooled by the simple and stylized look of Malmyr - The game is getting very complex, very fast. 12 magical runes enable you to make your buildings more efficient. The functionality of the Runes was heavily expanded with the Runemagic 2.0 patch. New ways to use and combine the runes to a total of 18 runewords will allow new strategies for the hardest missions Malmyr has to offer. You are sent to the forgotten lands of Malmyr by your King to expand the kingdom's territory and exploit Malmyr's precious ore deposits. While doing so you find out about the sinister fate of the Dwarves that once inhabited the continent. You will have to protect the kingdom from suffering the same! About us: We are two very passionate german devolpers who always wanted to make games. We decided to take a leap of faith and go for it. When buying this game you should keep that in mind. Malmyr is made with great love for detail and we hope that we can offer unique challenges with each mission, but it cannot offer hundreds of hours of playtime like bigger games with actual funding and a budget can. While we cannot promise to expand the game's content and currently have no plans to do so beyond Runemagic 2.0, we will continue to improve the game and fix bugs. Ziegler gamedev has the vision 'Making dreams come true'. We feel that part of that also is making the best game we can for our players. Mamlyr is... Inspired from games of our past and present - Like The Settlers, Anno and Factorio. 12 story based missions - You need to find a good strategy to complete them and handle the hazards thrown at you. Unique obstacles and ambience for missions - Each mission was made to give you a different experience: Sometimes more relaxing, sometimes more challenging than the previous one. Complex production chains - They will get longer and will need a wider variety of resources to function. A different take on resource transportation - You will not just connect buildings with a road, set up a transportation route or build conveyor belts. You will have to manage and optimize each piece of road manually. Over 45 different resources - Global resources like coin and food, building resources like wood and bricks and commodities for selling like jewelery. A range of over 70 buildings - From woodcutter's huts, to different mines, foundries and toolsmiths to be able to reach the rarest ores of Malmyr. 12 magical dwarven runes - They can be used in three ways: Terraforming your territory, magically creating resources or by socketing the runes in excavated ruins for permanent global bonus effects. 18 magical rune words - Combine three runes to form a special rune word with vastly different and powerful effects. Runecrafting - Allowing you to combine spare runes and convert them into other runes. Runecreation - Convert surplus coin into runes. Mamlyr isn't... War - There are no enemies, other than the mission itself, for you to fight. Mega-factories - You will not build one huge, ever growing mega-factory. The game is about fulfilling the task at hand: The current mission given to you by the King. After you are done with a mission, you will be sent to a new region and will have to handle a new task. Microtransactions - You get the full game by buying Malmyr. Static production chains you build and never touch again - You will need to adapt to your current mission. Sometimes, this means that you will have to sell buildings and rebuild them somewhere else.",35,524.65,25,1105,26,True,2020

It is a constrictive, oppressive environment which creates a feeling of helplessness, much like being a child stuck in the backseat of a car.

The Fight As the drive resumes, the emotional drama between the two parents comes to a crescendo. A new set of objects appears in the box.

You earn money by landing on property squares with investment opportunities, like a sushi restaurant in Ginza or an animation goods store in Akihabara. After you invest, you’ll have to wait until March rolls around for those investments to pay off. In the meantime, be on the lookout for errant monsters that may shower you with riches...or throw a wrench in your plans! You can also earn extra money by landing on item squares, which can either help you reach your own goals or simply ruin your rivals’ plans. If you finish the game with the most money...you win! 1. Brains, Bravado, and Lucky Breaks! Dice and random events will help decide your fate...but you’ll also need to invest wisely, take calculated risks, and rely on the whims of unpredictable monsters if you want to become Japan’s next billionaire! 2. Over 30 items and 50 monsters! You’ll encounter dozens of items and monsters, each with their own effects. Use them to push your opponents around, ruin their investments, and generally make their lives miserable. But be careful, because while they may help you earn money and pull ahead, they can also make bad purchases or investments on your behalf. This can change the game at a moment’s notice, so study the monsters well to make sure you know when to walk away, and when to run! 3. Multiple Modes Means Maximum Mayhem!

PRACTICAL PLAYTHING The ASTRA-256 software is an effective tool for those who want to learn the Assembly language, not knowing where to start. It is a fun toy for ‘real programmers’ and those remembering the old LPG-30, Altair 8800, PDP-11. Finally, it’s a very good mind-breaker, not wasting your time. With the ASTRA-256, you can solve real problems. For example, those real programmers solved at the dawn of computing. Along the way, acquiring Assembly programming skills, refreshing your math knowledge. REASONS TO LEARN ASSEMBLY LANGUAGE Assembly language allows to most effectively manage all the hardware resources. So it is used for programming many microcontroller devices. Assembly is still used to optimize programs written in higher-level languages. Assembly experience will give you an insight into how the magic happens. What turns hardware understanding only zeros and ones into a living intelligent computer? BACK TO THE PAST In the software, we tried to marry the atmosphere of the iconic first computers with a practical training tool. At the same time, you can prove yourself working in limited-resource conditions in which real programmers had been working in their days. ASTRA-256 FEATURES The software represents a virtual computer with a von Neumann architecture. At your disposal are the following resources: Architecture The 8-bit processor has an 8-bit accumulator, as well as 8-bit registers mapped to memory: instruction counter, input register, output register, stack pointer, FLAGS register. Memory The Astra-256 has 256 bytes of memory (exactly as it was in the first versions of the Altair 8800). Instruction Set The Assembly instruction set is quite extended and contains 102 instructions. But a novice user does not need to know all of them. It is enough to know only part of them to start writing the first assembly code. To learn more about instructions, click on the Help View button in the app or read detailed documentation on the official website. You might want to print it for more immersion in the programming process. Instructions grouped into 11 subdivisions: Processor Control Instructions Data Transfer Instructions Exchange Instructions Arithmetic and logical Instructions Shift Instructions Bit Manipulation Instructions Stack Manipulation Instructions Unconditional Transfer Instructions Conditional Transfer Instructions Input/Output Instructions Miscellaneous Instructions We provide the user with an extended set of instructions similar to those found in all modern microcontrollers, microprocessors. The ASTRA-256 allows for getting basic programming skills in low-level hardware. On these foundations, you can master the coding of any modern microcontroller. After all, its basic operating principles remain the same. PLAY, LEARN, PROGRAM! The ASTRA-256 is a tool with everything at hand. It allows puzzling over the solution of tasks with limited resources. Write in Assembly language a square root extraction program, a trigonometric function calculator, or an interactive game.

Plato (c.424–328 B.C.) describes it as a powerful and advanced kingdom that sank, in a night and a day, into the ocean around 9,600 B.C. The ancient Greeks were divided as to whether Plato’s story was to be taken as history or mere metaphor.

Hours of additional content in two side stories centering on villains Xenoarachne and Doppelganger. Stunning, high-resolution art from renowned artists Q-Gaku and Mogudan. Story The sacred kingdom of Ellerald is at war with the endless hordes of wretched monsters known as Lustfiends. Keeping them at bay are the mighty warriors of the Holy Guard, led by their fearless commander Noein—but when the Holy Guard are sent away to stem a suspiciously well-coordinated invasion, the capital is terrorized nightly by the foulest of beasts. Underdefended, the heart of the kingdom is on the brink of ruin. Desperate to save her people from suffering, Princess Cecily Ellerald makes a difficult decision. She forms a pact with the god-tree, Sephirot, granting Cecily the power to transform into a heavenly warrior capable of single-handedly curbing the lustfiend threat! Her divine powers as Eden's Ritter Lucifel are formidable, but costly, for the longer she uses them, the stronger her bodily urges become. Over the course of her adventure, Cecily must learn how to master her powers, lest her demonic foes should master her instead. To make matters worse, an even greater foe lurks in the shadows... the vile order of the Xenobides, who plot to use Princess Cecily’s newfound powers against her and usurp her kingdom. Their tentacles are everywhere, and their army of monsters will push our heroine to her limits... in more ways than one! Will Cecily succeed in defending the kingdom—or will her dark desires get the better of her, and seduce her to succumb to utter ecstasy?

Though she cares deeply for her people and wishes to help them in any way she can, she secretly resents her own weakness and envies the brave warrior Noein. Seizing the chance to gain power and defend her subjects, she becomes Eden’s Ritter Lucifel, a powerful magic-wielding warrior. But due to the forbidden nature of her new abilities, she must keep her identity a secret from the people she has sworn to protect. Commander Noein The leader of the Holy Guard, Noein is a hardened war veteran, adored by people far and wide. Not only has she devoted her blade to Princess Cecily, but the two have been close friends since childhood; to this day, to this knight, no sacrifice is too great to protect her princess. As the bulwark and buttress of the capital's defenses, her reluctant absence has left a gaping hole. How long can the city stand until she makes her return? And will her sword alone suffice for her to safeguard what she loves? Rudolf The archbishop of the Elleraldian faith. When the king falls ill with a mysterious ailment, Rudolf must accept the heavy burden of leading the kingdom during this time of peril—most reluctantly, of course. Though his leadership is admired by most members of the kingdom’s war council, others remain unconvinced, Noein included. Luxeria A mysterious nun with a bewitching smile. Though she adorns herself with a necklace bearing the symbol of the Elleraldian faith, her actions are unusual for a woman of her perceived status.

So, although it has anime characters, the fighting won't be anything like the animes that we're used to watch. You will actually have to keep your guard up, dodge, hit hard and make smart decisions, just like in a real fight with combat realism being the main philosophy, that's one of the reasons that there isn't TouchPad locomotion, because footwork is extremely important in a fight, due to that, Room Setup is necessary to play this game. Wanna hurt the opponent? Then swing your arms like you would in a real fight. And do expect to feel your arms heavy and lungs burning a little while playing this game ;) It has a unique feature that the opponent will block the incoming attack according to the direction that the player is striking or even try to knee the player if they see a level change of the player going for a takedown. The combat has a simple realistic fighting system, such as, the wider and faster your attack it, the more damage it will deal, just like in real life. It sounds silly, but this is one of the only or the only game like that out there for now. Most VR games out there, you can knock the opponent down by just waving the controller on the their faces really fast, and that's very unrealistic. Expect real challenges, each opponent having a different fighting style and ability. Although the combat is realistic, Heavens Tournament has a few flashy abilities inspired by Animes (and my personal favorite, Hunter x Hunter), making the combat even more fun.

The main goal of the lab is to do technical verification for the development of social experience such as simulating large-scale online war. Thanks to the breakthrough of HereticOS network basic technology, HereticOS Mr Lab for war simulator can realize the real-time online interaction of the largest 65000 online players on same server and screen . The goal is that the world in one server and world is in same screen. Due to the technical and cost constraints of Moore's law, the network war experience of our laboratory can be the only experience in the world in the next 30 years, so it will be updated, developed and maintained for a long time. Current technical direction and characteristics of the laboratory: 1. Large scale independent AI, each AI can be independently developed and implemented, and has certain social cooperation ability, such as following the arrangement of department leaders to complete specific tasks, AI is the main value and main line of war, not due to the number of players. 2. Giant units, which include multiple components and leading roles, can be found and collided, and carry basic role units to complete war tasks. 3. The client has no logic, all logic is completed in the AI virtual machine, the client has only basic input, and predicts the response to the war results, so the plug-in can be minimized. 4. The map has a maximum of 384 square kilometers, and the global public view has a maximum of 18 kilometers. There is no war smoke, so you can see every war detail in the world as long as you want. 5. 65000 units are on-line with the same service and the same screen. The goal is to serve the same service globally. In principle, they are not divided into different services. They are only divided according to the needs of regional delay. There is no copy, no krypton gold, one-time payment, limited free experience for life, 6. 256 channel 3D stereo, real-time rendering battlefield sound effect 7. Support X360 pad and vibration feedback. Play method 1. Players need to learn mainstream art tools, such as 3DMAX and C4D, to make free mod or commercial mod for the laboratory, About mod res make knowledge, can find by official community production group. 2. Players need to participate in social activities through mainstream social tools, improve your idea of war experience, and organize to find possible teams to participate in mod production. If you don't have certain social ability, then 65000 people will only have ”you“ and ”AI“ 3. If you are not familiar with Chinese, you should learn Chinese and receive necessary Chinese education, such as the Ichang, because war AI is written by I Ching language. If you do not have the necessary Chinese literacy, it will be difficult to organize a war with profound significance. In the dawn DLC, we mainly show the characteristics of war experience in the HereticOS Mr lab, including four maps with different backgrounds in spring, summer, autumn and winter, In this scene, there are three defensive tower fortresses, two opposing floating castles, one attacking Castle wandering on the map, two teams, each with 30000 units. Three leaders respectively control three floating castles and two teams of ground troops. One (Zhuge Liang) controls a team of archers to fire arrows (30000), and one (Zhou Yu) controls an air castle to cruise and attack with soldiers , a (Xu Chu) gathers a sword shield soldier opposite the archer. The player can control a helicopter, manually control four simulation skills, simulate and control the launch of four bombs of different sizes and weights, and use the keyboard or handle to manually charge the skill capacitor. After the charging is completed, release the corresponding charging button to launch the projectile. After the shell hits the ground unit, the ground unit will fall Death (units in the floating castle will not fall to death at this time), and the ability capacitance determines the apparent speed of the projectile The difference between simulated launch and numerical control launch Simulation launch, the firing strength is determined by the skill capacitance, and the ammunition speed is regulated by the infinite Numerical control launch, unable to control the skill firing intensity, each time the ammunition is monotonous the same parameter (speed). About mod (DLC) production 1. Use blender, 3dmax and other production tools to make 3D models for the game. The game supports static 3D models in the format of 3DS FBX, obj, and character animation in MD2 format. If you have other character animation models, you need to use the MD2 export plug-in of 3DMAX to convert the animation model to MD2. 2. Provide sound effect materials. At present, it supports MP3 file format and collective sound effect mode, that is, all sound effects are put into one MP3 file 3. Put all game resource data into the mod directory provided by you, such as 'data/Dawn' 4. Search HereticOS Mr Lab project in GitHub, download game resource definition template GameRes.h gamereslib.h of dawn DLC, modify the definition according to the resources you provide, compile and execute to generate mod resource file, such as game.mod . 5. Go to the community to share your mod resources. After we pass the review, they will be put into the hereticos Mr lab server to make an appointment and push it to you, your friends and interested players. Detailed play method can pay attention to QQ group of laboratory community 739924481 Player benefits 1. HereticOS MR LAB only contains programs, not MOD. You need to participate in community activities to find MOD 2. The laboratory itself is upgraded free of charge for life, with limited free service content. Limited free services include free mod experience, queuing for appointment when the server is free, etc. 3. Player mod can't contain any pornographic content and bad information. The HereticOS Mr lab war simulator is anti war, rendering people's hurt and pain caused by cruel war. Any content with inconsistent ultimate goal will not be allowed to release mod Brief introduction to the development background of the laboratory 10000 people listen to bow and arrow rain, which is the basic demand index for 5g experience such as MMORPG and Mr proposed in the early stage of the Internet in 1998, which determines MMORPG Mr's basic experience quality, listening to bow and arrow rain is a global dynamic interactive effect, which can only be realized by single map and single server, and can't be expanded in a distributed way. According to the plan, a battle in Chibi, a small-scale battle, requires 400000 people to be online on the same screen, 5-20tbps bandwidth single map server, which needs 50000 times of server bandwidth at that time. According to Moore's law, it will take 50 years, but these 20 The annual performance of the network server only increased by 2-5 times, which led to MMORPG only giving up the world map, giving up the user's social interaction and opening more copies, leading to the game transforming into the online krypton gold stand-alone game, which eventually went to failure. Therefore, the realization of 10000 people listening to the bow and arrow rain is expected to stay ahead of the world for 30 years and achieve the only real-time war experience in the world. At present, HereticOS OS Mr Lab for war simulator has been initially formed. The output bandwidth of 65000 people on a single map and a screen is 200g, which can realize the real-time battlefield of 10000 people listening to the bow and arrow rain on a small scale. For example, the 2D online games are generally the same as the map service 2000 units and the screen 200 units, the field of vision is 50m, the 3D online games are the same as the map service 800 units, the screen 50 units and the field of vision is 200m, while a typical bow and arrow rain needs 1500m field of vision, and the archer 2 units More than 10000 people listen to the effect of bow and arrow rain. At present, the effect of bow and arrow rain will only appear in the movie works. For example, the movie of Lord of the rings needs to serve 100000 units on the same screen, with a vision of 6000 meters, and the same screen needs to accommodate four scenes of bow and arrow rain. Therefore, the online game effect of the movie of Lord of the rings will be the only experience in the world in 30 years",0,0.0,0,1238,0,True,2020

It immerses the player in a crowd of thousands, against a changing canvas that is at varying points wondrous and intimidating, realistic and fantastical. You control one solitary, glowing avatar amongst a mass of autonomous strangers, each of whose movements react to your own. As your pace and directions influence others as both individuals and as a whole, you essentially become the choreographer of the crowd. The crowd’s movements are programmed to simulate intelligent behaviours (including avoidance, following and mimicry), reflecting the seemingly endless ways that humans act in group settings. Viewed from above, these movements create mesmerising patterns against the landscape. A shaft of light beckons you – each time you reach the light, this landscape shifts, along with its soundtrack, gravity, atmosphere and mode of movement. Emergence doesn’t dictate a goal. There’s no fixed succession of tasks that lead you to ‘completing’ the game. The experience instead is a powerful challenge to the player’s perception. Are you a leader inspiring a devoted following, or a defenceless figure overwhelmed by the encroaching horde? Emergence compels you to adjust to each transformation in your surrounding environment – all the while bringing you face to face with the primal desire to maintain your individual identity while being part of a crowd.
